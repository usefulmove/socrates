# DuckDB SQL Workspace

This project is a dedicated space for working with DuckDB SQL.

I will be using Gemini as a resource for questions and coding assistance. Gemini has access to the DuckDB SQL documentation located in the `sql/` directory and can use it to answer questions and help with coding problems.

## SQL Documentation Overview

The `sql/` directory contains a comprehensive set of Markdown files detailing DuckDB's SQL dialect. The documentation is organized into the following subdirectories:

*   `data_types/`: Detailed information on supported data types like `ARRAY`, `BLOB`, `DATE`, `INTEGER`, `VARCHAR`, etc.
*   `dialect/`: Explanations of DuckDB's SQL dialect, including its close relationship with PostgreSQL and any differences.
*   `expressions/`: Documentation on various SQL expressions, such as `CASE`, `CAST`, and subqueries.
*   `functions/`: A comprehensive list of scalar, aggregate, and window functions available in DuckDB.
*   `meta/`: Information about meta queries, such as `duckdb_table_functions()` and the `information_schema`.
*   `query_syntax/`: Detailed explanations of SQL query clauses like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, etc.
*   `statements/`: Descriptions of SQL statements for data definition (DDL) and data manipulation (DML), such as `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.

The root of the `sql/` directory also contains introductory and overview documents.

## Accessing the Documentation

I have full access to the DuckDB SQL documentation located in the `sql/` directory. I can use this documentation to answer your questions and help with coding problems.


## Communication
In all interactions, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
