the bowl cracks,
the bath cools,
the light slips off her skin —
still you stay,
hands open,
learning to love
what doesn’t stay still.

a moment is enough
when you let it be a moment.

even code —
a few clean lines,
curved like breath —
can teach you
how the world was made:
not by force,
but by attention.

what you notice
grows whole.

what you accept
turns beautiful.
