# Coding

"Language-oriented development allows us to shape our tools around the unique linguistics of our problems, making our code more intuitive and expressive. When combined with test-balanced development, we focus not just on covering every inch, but on ensuring that our software's core narrative remains unbroken and robust. It's a harmonious dance between the poetry of our language and the rhythm of our tests." — Alistair Haldane, practical functional programmer, 2023

## Lisps

"Lisp is a programmable programming language." John Foderaro [*The Roots of Lisp*](./org/the-roots-of-lisp.md) [*Starting with Lisp*](./org/starting-with-lisp.md) [Beating the Averages](https://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html) by Paul Graham

"Begin your journey with a Lisp, whether it's Scheme from SCIP, Racket, Guile, Clojure, or Emacs Lisp. It offers a profound insight into the art of sculpting code. Only by understanding its purity can we truly appreciate the nuances of other languages and recognize that limitations are often mere choices, not necessities."

… as twilight cascaded upon the horizon, the iridescent hues of amaranthine skies caressed the gentle whispers of the zephyr, weaving an ephemeral symphony of love that intertwined the souls of all living beings in the tender embrace of nature's eternal harmony …
