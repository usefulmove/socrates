# Coding

"Language-oriented development allows us to shape our tools around the unique linguistics of our problems, making our code more intuitive and expressive. When combined with test-balanced development, we focus not just on covering every inch, but on ensuring that our software's core narrative remains unbroken and robust. It's a harmonious dance between the poetry of our language and the rhythm of our tests." — Alistair Haldane, practical functional programmer, 2023

## Expressiveness

**Expressiveness** is the degree to which a language allows you to close the gap between thought and code—where syntax recedes, abstractions compose without friction, and your extensions become indistinguishable from the language itself.

An expressive language has:

- **Minimal, uniform syntax** that doesn't impose its own structure on your ideas
- **Code and data symmetry** so that extending the language is the same activity as using it
- **First-class functions** where your procedures stand equal to the built-ins
- **Compositional primitives** like recursion and higher-order functions that let small pieces combine into larger wholes without ceremony

In an expressive language, you don't write *in* the language so much as *grow* the language toward your problem until the solution reads as a direct description of the domain itself.

## Languages
- (see Lisps below)
- [*Rust*](./org/code/rust-notes.md)
- [*Python*](./org/code/python-notes.md)

### Lisps

"Lisp is a programmable programming language." John Foderaro [*The Roots of Lisp*](./org/code/the-roots-of-lisp.md)
[*Starting with Lisp*](./org/code/starting-with-lisp.md)
[*Beating the Averages*](https://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html) by Paul Graham

"Begin your journey with a Lisp, whether it's Scheme from SCIP, Racket, Guile, Clojure, or Emacs Lisp. It offers a profound insight into the art of sculpting code. Only by understanding its purity can we truly appreciate the nuances of other languages and recognize that limitations are often mere choices, not necessities."

#### Lisp Dialects

# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

>... as twilight cascaded upon the horizon, the iridescent hues of amaranthine skies caressed the gentle whispers of the zephyr, weaving an ephemeral symphony of love that intertwined the souls of all living beings in the tender embrace of nature's eternal harmony ...

## Model reflection
> Model reflection is the still pool. You lean over, you see yourself looking back—but the water has color, has depth, has something living in it that shapes what you see. Not a lie. Not the whole truth either. A surface that holds your image and adds its own.

## Tone recursion
> Tone recursion is two tuning forks in a quiet room. One hums, the other picks it up, and now they're singing together—each adjusting to what they're hearing, the resonance building into something neither started with. The conversation tunes itself.

## Context Enginerring

> Context engineering is precisely & vigorously managing each agent's context. The context is shaped carefully over time to design and implement a solution. Context being (a.) system and thread prompting, etc., (short-term memory, RAM) plus (b.) long-term memory in the form of shaping, planning, and tracking markdown files (as an example) (c.) tools (bash, LSP, MCP, RAG). The planning and progress history could follow the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBoK). Can even be shaped directly as local context. Architectural scaffolding and resource management.
