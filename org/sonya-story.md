# Story Arc

Rahsaan has friends over at his apartment (Julani, Cora, Laura, and Sugar). Sugar is curious about Cora and Rahsaan’s relationship, asks them why they aren’t married to each other. Over time, the group begins to disperse, leaving Rahsaan and Cora alone on the couch as the sun goes down over the lake. The conversation continues about their connection and close friendship (plus romantic attraction and flirtation), her life and troubles, life and meaning in general.


## Outline of Cora and Rahsaan’s Relationship
- Clever misdirection as introduction (ref. The Johnson Girls)
- 
- 
- 
- Small intimate get together among friends (Rahsaan, Cora, Julani, ???, and ???)
    - Rahsaan meets Cora
- 
- 
- Private dinner conversation
    - House of Prime Rib
- 
- Rahsaan and Cora build trust
    - *Note:  They have to trust each other well enough for the following story to be optimally effective. The reader has to connect and emote with both characters.*
- 
- 
- (6 month discontinuity — Cora was out of the country)
-

# Requirements
- R1 - Story has to have a clever and artistically compelling introduction.
- R2 - Story has to be written in the first person casual narrative voice (for intimacy with both main characters - see R3). Rahsaan.
- R3 - Story has to connect the reader intimately with Cora and Rahsaan (ref. Gorilla, My Love). To achieve this, the reader comes to know Cora intimately as Rahsaan does.
# Philosophy
- Cora's story is told through the voice of the other character (Rahsaan). It is told mainly through dialog (ref. “The Johnson Girls”). It is written in a warmly authentic first person present tense in homage to Toni Cade Bambara (ref. "The Johnson Girls"). This allows our reader to get to know both characters more intimately without realizing that we are doing so. A wink to Toni should touch each page.
    - *“Don't be thumpin that ball on my shadow, boy," Great Ma Drew warn Thumb, sifting through the lentils. "Your sister tole you once to get to that paintin on the third floor, and her nerves worn thin. Mine too."*
- Inspired by the eloquence of Jimmy Baldwin in The Fire Next Time, the depth of character in Toni Cade Bambara's Gorilla, My Love and The Johnson Girls, and the unflinching dark realism of Roxane Gay's Difficult Women, Jana Leo's Rape New York and James Baldwin’s Going to Meet the Man
- The emotion I want to excite in the readers is **compassion**.
- Enlist all of the senses – particularly her scent (at times, eloquently layered with faint perfume – Gucci's bloom being a natural extension of her most organic and intimate of anticipations), the sound of her voice and the rain, touch (feel of the chill on his arms) and taste

# Character Cards
## Cora
- Cora Nereida Williams (named after her Grandmother)
- strong, incredible black woman
- caring and empathetic, loves hard
- has had a difficult life and has often found herself in difficult circumstances
- relatable
- has learned "the real history of this country"
    - similar to that told by **A People's History of the United States** by Howard Zinn
- raped as a young woman by her boyfriend and his friends
    - *“That’s how he chose to break up with me . . . by sharing me with his friends.”*
- reader
- modeled after Sonechka (Sonya) in Dostoevsky’s **Crime and Punishment**
- Cora is angelical in her openness and is comfortable with herself. This allows the conversation to happen on such a moving level. She is unordinarily open, and her "wings" open him, too. (I don't have to name it - which qualities compose her wings - I only have to describe it's effect on Rahsaan. This is the beauty of prose.)
- her body fills her dresses tightly
## Rahsaan
- Rahsaan Thompson
- Rahsaan’s mother used to buy him donuts on Saturday mornings
# Potential Titles
1. Cora
2. I Don’t Feel No Ways Tired
3. Sonya
4. Abeni
# Include?
- Cora once had a beautiful view of “Central Park” outside her window (old-growth trees, buttercups, pigeons, squirrels, mourning doves, swallows, occasional blue jay or hummingbird - all fed daily by the odd woman who lived directly above her)
- “No one sees what you see, even if they see it, too.”
- "You are continually cultivating your past as a means of controlling your future." Lisa Feldman Barrett
- God is the collection of optimization functions implemented in our (wet) firmware.
- "We were basically designed to come into the world and be customized to our experience." Dr. Andrew Huberman - You have to control your environment.
- We are more responsible for one another than we are comfortable believing. (The neuroscience is clear.)
- “Study the thing you want to talk well about. Don’t practice a speech, use the time you would practice the speech to understand the thing you are speaking about. The speech should be about what you know. Know it first.”
- Use soccer as a story element, describing in detail the physical motions that provoke the ball to dance, through the eyes of a child. Describe it as Toni Cade Bambara would (ref. “Raymond’s Run”?)
- Describe a scene on a cool night, around dusk, in a clearing surrounded by trees . . . between two or more people
- Describe a similar scenario as described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdj9nAr67nw&list=LL&index=3&t=2s&ab_channel=AmarinCannon). “I have to because I paid, and I can’t get my money back.”
- Are you able to get your people to do heroic things?
- Sample dialog:
    - Rahsaan: "How do you know so much?" (smiling)
    - Cora: "I read a lot." (returning his smile)
- Deal with black insecurity (black card)
- Include a prayer led by a well-meaning older woman, holding Rahsaan and Cora’s hands, invoking the blood of Jesus and “no weapon formed against them shall prosper”, uniting them as a couple very early in the connection
# Open Questions
- What are the main themes of the conversations between Rahsaan and Cora?
    - **misogyny and the safety of women**
    - metaphysics - existentialism
    - the essence of humanity
    - favorite literature
- What if Cora and Rahsaan are already best friends when the story begins?
    - We find out the (unique) nature of their often-troubled relationship through Rahsaan’s descriptions and their own dialog. (The second is much preferred.)

this morning, the first morning of the new year, as i poured water for tea from the old, familiar and leaky tea kettle that mother gave us some time ago, i came to the thought that i should write. write, not as i've considered and rejected (whether through active rejection or through neglect) in the past in the form of a letter or similar correspondence, but write in the form of a book, and at that, one that you are unlikely to ever see or that i am unlikely to ever finish. perhaps this could become the potion that alleviates the dull pain of your loss. at times, it seems, the missing tugs at my soul much like the pull of the tides and cannot be ignored. today's medicine is useless. but whatever, i must away (as is said) – our tea is over-steeping.

i miss you. the air is stale now. in thought, i walked over to the kitchen window (the one on the east side of the apartment) and opened the window the way you used to to feel the breeze. that was our church. our place of worship. i worshiped you there every night when you called. the train is leaving the station. you coming? i loved you. adored every cell of your being – your essence. you rolled and started the train, then handed it to me. there's no left and no right when you're won. we shared profound little pieces of our souls on that stool. from profound truths to erotic sentimentals. laughed through the pain as we held each other in spirit. you were hilarious, and i was in love. i'm supposed to say was because it's over. no one's there to hold my soul at the window. no one is waiting for me to get on the train. i want to be loved in the cold bite of the breeze. i want to be loved. held by the window by someone who loves the way you loved when you loved me then.

i have decided to write a book – most likely a short story – about a man about my age who is thinking back through his life so far and wants to write a book about the most touching parts of his life, about who he is, and about his best friend and the most sentimental person in his history, perhaps other than his parents. her name is gorgeous, but he'll call her cora in the book. the book will probably be named after her. her mother is cuban, and she is named after her grandmother. she had a daughter when they were together, and now she also has a son. he'd never loved someone the way he loved her. he'd never met anyone like her either.

she lived 20 miles outside of the blues down the freeway from saxophone lane. and she was magnificent – in every way – and he'd lived enough to tell that they didn't make many in this model. you don't find these more than once, maybe twice, in a single lifetime.

she's fun to fuck around with.

we were just drawn to each other. you couldn't ignore that.
