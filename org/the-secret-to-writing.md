# The secret to writing
I don't know how to begin to tell you how much you mean to me. I tell everyone I know how lucky I am to have a mother like you, someone who sacrificed to give me everything she could . . . to give me the start in life everyone deserves. You held me accountable because it was what I needed to become a better person, to grow, to have a chance to approach my potential. You also gave me the freedom I needed to be responsible for my own life and live it the way I thought best, freedom to make mistakes and love while you helped me up whenever I fell short. Everyone deserves a mother like you, most people get someone else. We'll always be inseparable because I'd never become the man I'm trying to be if you hadn't been the woman you are.
