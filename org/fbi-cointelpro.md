# Primary Documents

Here are **primary documents** (with tiny quotes) showing COINTELPRO in the FBI’s own words:

## Aug. 25, 1967 directive (launching the “Black Nationalist–Hate Groups” COINTELPRO).

Purpose: “\*to expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize\*” targeted groups and their supporters. Lists initial targets and tactics. [Church Committee Archive](https://www.aarclibrary.md/publib/church/reports/book3/pdf/ChurchB3_1_COINTELPRO.pdf)

## Stated goals: stop a unifying Black leader.

FBI memo summarized by the Senate says: “\*Prevent the rise of a messiah who could unify and electrify the militant nationalist movement\*,” naming King, Carmichael, and Elijah Muhammad. [Church Committee Archive](https://www.aarclibrary.md/publib/church/reports/book3/pdf/ChurchB3_3_BlackPanthers.pdf)

## Orders to stoke conflicts against the Panthers.

Hoover told field offices to submit “\*imaginative and hard-hitting counterintelligence measures\*” to exploit a “gang warfare” climate between the Black Panther Party and US Organization.

## Fred Hampton raid—FBI informant intel handed to police.

## The anonymous “suicide letter” to Dr. King (1964).

The typed letter (scan available) tells King “\*You are done\*,” implying he should end his life; it accompanied surveillance tapes. (FOIA vault + scan.) [FBI Vault](https://vault.fbi.gov/Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.)

## Congress’s judgment on COINTELPRO.

The Church Committee concluded the FBI used “\*unsavory and vicious tactics\*” (including anonymous attempts to break up marriages) and engaged in **lawless** methods against political activists. [Church Committee Report (Loveman archive)](https://loveman.sdsu.edu/docs/1976Churchcommittee.pdf)

# Notes

If you want, I can pull the **exact pages** from those PDFs into a quick packet, or dig up more (e.g., Klan and New Left COINTELPRO files, MLK wiretap authorizations).
