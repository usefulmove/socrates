# On Selfishness

## The Traditional View

Throughout history, selfishness has often been identified as a driving force behind evil acts. From betrayals in ancient epics to modern tales of corporate greed, a recurrent narrative emerges, painting selfishness as a core element of evil. While it is tempting to simplify and label all selfish acts as inherently malevolent, the relationship between selfishness and evil is more intricate, deserving a closer examination.

At its essence, selfishness can be defined as prioritizing one's own needs, desires, or interests above those of others. In many cases, the harm caused by such behavior is unmistakable. For instance, a leader who exploits his country's resources for personal gain, leaving his people impoverished, acts selfishly and creates tangible harm. Similarly, an individual who betrays a friend's trust for personal benefit exemplifies the destructive potential of unchecked selfishness.

This direct link between selfishness and harm lends credence to the idea that selfishness is central to evil. Philosophers, religious leaders, and moralists frequently underscore the importance of empathy, altruism, and selflessness as virtues that counteract evil. By placing the well-being of others on an equal or even higher pedestal than oneself, the reasoning goes, one minimizes the potential to inflict harm.

Moreover, from a sociological perspective, communities and societies thrive on cooperation and mutual support. Excessive selfishness disrupts this balance. When individuals act solely in their own interest without considering the broader consequences, the foundation of trust, a crucial element for societal cohesion, begins to erode. This breakdown can culminate in larger evils such as societal discord, conflict, and even war.

## The Nuance

Yet, painting all selfishness with a broad brush of evil risks oversimplification. Selfishness, in some contexts, is a survival mechanism. The instinct to prioritize one's own safety and well-being is hardwired into humans through evolution. After all, self-preservation is a fundamental drive. Moreover, not every act of self-interest necessarily results in harm to others. An entrepreneur working tirelessly to achieve personal success might be acting out of self-interest, but this doesn't inherently make their actions evil.

Additionally, motivations behind actions are multifaceted. Acts can be spurred by a mix of both selfish and selfless intentions. For instance, philanthropy, while benefiting others, might also boost the donor's reputation or satisfy their personal desire to feel good about themselves.

While selfishness undoubtedly plays a significant role in many manifestations of evil, it's essential to approach the topic with nuance. Not all acts of self-interest are malevolent, and motivations are multifaceted. Recognizing this complexity helps in forming a more sophisticated understanding of the nature of evil and the ways to counteract it. The challenge lies not in eradicating selfishness, but in balancing self-interest with empathy, understanding, and a commitment to the collective good.

## Personal Synthesis: The Question of Self

The deeper question is: What is the self that is being selfish?

### The Expanding Circle of Self

We can define the self at different boundaries:

**Narrow Self**: Just my body, my immediate needs, my momentary desires. This is the self of a child, focused on instant gratification.

**Extended Self**: Includes family, close friends, team. What benefits them benefits me, because their well-being is part of my well-being. The parent who sacrifices for children isn't being selfless—the child's success IS the parent's success.

**Organizational Self**: The leader whose identity is bound up with the company. Is working 80-hour weeks selfish or selfless? Both and neither—if the organization's success is your success, the distinction collapses.

**Universal Self**: The view that all beings are interconnected, that harming anyone harms yourself, that helping anyone helps yourself. This is the mystic's view, found in Buddhism, Stoicism, and [Alan Watts](on-the-nature-of-consciousness.md).

The "selfishness" of an action depends entirely on which boundary you draw around self.

### The Trap of False Selflessness

There's a particularly pernicious form of selfishness disguised as selflessness: the person who gives and gives and gives, then resents others for not appreciating it enough. The manager who works themselves to exhaustion "for the team," then passive-aggressively holds it over them. The parent who sacrifices everything "for the children," then guilt-trips them about it.

This isn't selflessness—it's self-interest with plausible deniability. The giving is a strategy to earn moral superiority, to accumulate debt that others owe you, to avoid examining your own needs.

True generosity doesn't keep score. It gives because giving is who you are, not because you expect payback.

## Selfish vs Self-Interested

There's a useful distinction to make:

**Self-interested**: Acting in accordance with your values and needs. Saying no to things that don't serve you. Prioritizing your growth. Taking care of your health. This is not only acceptable but necessary—you can't pour from an empty cup.

**Selfish**: Acting in accordance with your desires at the expense of others, especially when you're in a position of power over them. Using people as means rather than ends. Taking more than your share of a shared resource.

The difference is often about power dynamics and zero-sum vs positive-sum:

**Positive-sum self-interest**: I learn functional programming because I find it beautiful and it makes me a better engineer. This benefits me AND potentially my team.

**Zero-sum selfishness**: I hoard knowledge to maintain job security, making myself indispensable by ensuring no one else can do my job. This benefits me AT THE EXPENSE of team capability.

## The Selfish Gene vs The Altruistic Phenotype

From evolutionary biology, we learn a paradox: genes are "selfish" (they propagate themselves), but this leads to altruistic behavior in organisms (caring for kin, cooperation, reciprocal altruism).

The parallel in organizations: Individual incentives can be "selfish," but well-designed systems channel that self-interest toward collective benefit. The question isn't whether people are selfish, but whether their self-interest aligns with collective good.

**Misaligned Incentives**: The executive whose bonus is tied to quarterly stock price, leading to short-term decisions that destroy long-term value. They're acting rationally within their incentive structure, but the incentive structure is corrupt.

**Aligned Incentives**: The engineer whose growth is tied to team capability, who benefits most when their knowledge is shared and their systems empower others. Self-interest and collective interest align.

This is the insight behind [Moloch](meditations-on-moloch.md): the problem isn't individual selfishness but systemic incentives that turn individual rationality into collective ruin.

## Selfishness in Leadership

Leadership exposes the question of selfishness in sharp relief:

### The Selfish Leader

- Makes decisions that benefit their career over team/company
- Takes credit for wins, deflects blame for losses
- Hoards information and decision-making power
- Builds dependencies rather than capabilities
- Optimizes for looking good over being effective
- Uses people as stepping stones

This is selfishness in its clearest form—using a position of power to extract value at others' expense.

### The Self-Interested Leader

- Builds team capability because strong teams make them more effective
- Shares knowledge because they benefit from a knowledgeable team
- Delegates because it frees them to work at higher leverage
- Develops people because their success reflects well and creates opportunities
- Admits mistakes because trust is more valuable than ego

The self-interest is real—they benefit from these actions. But so does everyone else. This is positive-sum.

### The Challenge of Self-Awareness

The hard part is that selfish leaders usually don't see themselves as selfish. They have stories:
- "I'm hoarding information because the team isn't ready"
- "I'm taking credit because I need political capital to protect the team"
- "I'm not delegating because no one else can do it as well"

These stories might even be partially true. But they're also convenient justifications for selfish behavior.

The test: If you were removed tomorrow, would the team be stronger or weaker? If weaker because you hoarded rather than shared, you were selfish. If stronger because you built capability, you were self-interested in a healthy way.

## The Paradox of Self-Sacrifice

There's a weird paradox in leadership and parenting: the most effective practitioners often appear to be the most self-sacrificing, working long hours, putting others first, seemingly giving endlessly.

But look closer: they're not sacrificing themselves—they're EXPRESSING themselves. The parent who devotes themselves to children isn't sacrificing—this IS what they want to be doing. The leader who works 80-hour weeks building a company isn't sacrificing—this is their mission, their meaning.

The appearance of self-sacrifice often masks profound self-interest—just at a different time horizon and with a different definition of self.

The person who truly sacrifices—who does things they hate for people they don't care about out of obligation—burns out. The person who appears to sacrifice but is actually expressing their deepest values—that person can sustain indefinitely.

## When Selfishness is Necessary

There are times when what looks like selfishness is actually necessary:

**Boundaries**: Saying no to protect your time, energy, focus. This looks selfish to those you're saying no to, but it's essential to doing anything meaningful.

**Exit**: Leaving a team, company, or relationship that's unhealthy, even when others want you to stay. This looks selfish but is often the most honest thing you can do.

**Growth**: Choosing to learn and develop even when it doesn't have immediate team benefit. The IC who wants to study category theory might seem selfish to the manager who wants them focused on shipping features. But long-term, depth of understanding creates more value than relentless feature production.

**Self-Care**: Taking care of your physical and mental health even when there are deadlines, when people need you, when it would be convenient to push through. This is self-interested, but necessary—you're no good to anyone if you're broken.

The question isn't whether these acts are selfish, but whether they're justified. And that depends on context, power dynamics, alternatives.

## The Integration: Enlightened Self-Interest

The resolution isn't to eliminate self-interest but to expand it:

**Short-term vs Long-term**: Short-term selfishness grabs immediate benefit. Long-term self-interest invests in relationships, reputation, skills, systems.

**Narrow vs Broad**: Narrow self-interest optimizes for me alone. Broad self-interest recognizes that my well-being is bound up with my team's, my family's, my community's.

**Zero-sum vs Positive-sum**: Zero-sum selfishness takes from a fixed pie. Positive-sum self-interest grows the pie.

The goal isn't to become selfless—that's both impossible and undesirable. The goal is to expand your circle of self, lengthen your time horizon, and find ways to align your interests with others'.

When your team's success is your success, working for them IS working for you. When your children's flourishing is your flourishing, investing in them IS investing in you. When the quality of your code affects the productivity of future maintainers (including future you), writing clean code IS selfishness.

This is enlightened self-interest: acting in ways that benefit you by benefiting others.

## The Ultimate Question

The deep question isn't "Am I being selfish?" but "What self am I serving?"

- The self of the next five minutes, or the next five years?
- The self defined by ego, or the self defined by values?  
- The self separate from others, or the self that includes them?
- The self that needs validation, or the self that needs meaning?

Your answer to that question determines whether your self-interest is destructive or generative, whether it diminishes others or elevates them, whether it's selfishness or something closer to wisdom.
