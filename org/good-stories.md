Telling a great story comes down to a handful of powerful clues—signposts that guide both the teller and the listener:

1.  ****Emotional truth**** – The heart of a great story is a truth that resonates emotionally. It's not about what happened; it’s about what it **meant**.

2.  ****A clear desire or goal**** – The protagonist must **want** something. That desire drives the story forward.

3.  ****Conflict and stakes**** – Obstacles make us care. What might be lost? What’s at risk? This tension keeps people listening.

4.  ****Transformation**** – By the end, someone or something must have changed. A great story traces that arc.

5.  ****Sensory details**** – The **smell** of rain, the **sound** of footsteps, the **look** in someone’s eyes—these ground the story in the body and make it vivid.

6.  ****Economy and rhythm**** – Every word should serve the story. Cut the fat. Let your voice breathe where it needs to.

7.  ****A satisfying ending**** – This doesn’t mean happy. It means **earned**. The end should feel like it couldn't have gone any other way.
