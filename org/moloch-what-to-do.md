It's the most important question there is, a specific, individual-level plan to fight a systemic, collective demon.

This is the fundamental paradox of Moloch. The system punishes the individual who tries to opt out. If you're the one factory that installs expensive filters, you go out of business. If you're the one employee who refuses to play the office politics game, you get passed over for promotion. The very nature of the problem seems to make individual action futile.

Your belief that the individual level is our only chance seems, on the surface, to contradict this. But it doesn't. It's the resolution to the paradox.

You cannot slay Moloch by fighting it head-on. The system is too big. You will lose. You prevail by making yourself immune to its logic and then creating small, protected spaces—sanctuaries—where a different set of rules applies. You build an ark, not a weapon. This is done individual by individual, group by group.

Here is a rubric—a framework for action—built on that idea. It moves from the inside out, from fortifying yourself to connecting with others.

### The Rubric for Prevailing Over Moloch

This is a practice, not a one-time fix. It has three layers of escalating engagement.

#### Level 1: Fortify Your Inner Sanctuary (The Self)

Before you can change anything outside of you, you must stop running Moloch's operating system inside your own head. The goal here is to become a person who is *capable* of defecting from the race-to-the-bottom and surviving.

*   **Action 1: Define Your "Good" with Unforgiving Specificity.** "Being a good person" is a weak, fuzzy goal. Moloch eats fuzzy goals for breakfast. You must decide, explicitly, what your principles are. Write them down. For example: "I will not speak ill of a colleague behind their back to gain an advantage." "I will pay more for a product made by a company that treats its workers with dignity." "I will prioritize an hour of uninterrupted time with my family over an extra hour of work." These become your non-negotiables. A personal constitution. When you are tempted by the "rational" choice that Moloch offers, you consult your constitution.
*   **Action 2: Practice Self-Coordination.** We are often a collection of competing desires. The part of you that wants to be healthy competes with the part that wants to eat junk food. The part that wants to learn a skill competes with the part that wants to scroll on social media. This is Moloch on a personal scale. Your individual task is to solve this multi-polar trap *within yourself*. Pick one such conflict in your life. Mediate a truce. Maybe you don't ban junk food, but you coordinate a "peace treaty" where you only eat it on Saturdays. By learning to coordinate your own inner "demons," you are training for the real thing. You are building the muscle of long-term thinking over short-term gratification.
*   **Action 3: Seek and Create Positive-Sum Games.** Moloch thrives on zero-sum thinking ("for me to win, you must lose"). Your personal task is to relentlessly seek, identify, and create positive-sum games ("we can both win"). Start small. In a conversation, instead of trying to "win" the argument, try to find a synthesis of your view and the other person's. At work, instead of hoarding information to make yourself indispensable, share it to make your whole team more effective. Frame your life as a quest to find win-win scenarios. This rewires your brain to see opportunities for collaboration where others see only competition.

#### Level 2: Build an Interpersonal Sanctuary (The Pair or Trio)

Once you are a fortified node, you must find other nodes. Moloch is a multi-polar *trap*. The escape is multi-polar *coordination*. This starts with just one other person.

*   **Action 4: Speak the Truth. Full Stop.** Jordan Peterson's maxim is crucial here. Molochian dynamics are built on a foundation of "strategic" communication—the half-truth to the boss, the exaggerated claim in the ad, the polite but fake agreement in the meeting. Your individual vow must be to remove yourself from this. Speak with uncompromising, compassionate honesty. This will feel risky. It is. But it has a magic effect: it makes you a beacon for other truth-tellers. It builds trust, which is the currency that fuels all non-Molochian systems. You can't have coordination without trust. You can't have trust without truth.
*   **Action 5: Master the "Good-Faith Argument".** Moloch wants us to see each other as caricatures in a culture war. Your individual rebellion is to refuse. When you encounter a view you disagree with, your task is not to defeat it, but to understand it so well that you can articulate it back to the other person, better than they did themselves (this is called "steelmanning"). This practice is the direct antidote to the outrage algorithms. It replaces conflict with understanding. Two people practicing this can solve almost any problem.
*   **Action 6: Explicitly Reward Virtue in Others.** When you see someone else take a stand against a race-to-the-bottom, *make it your mission to reward them*. Did a local coffee shop decide to pay its baristas a living wage, making their coffee 50 cents more expensive? Go there, pay the extra, and *tell them why* you're there. Did a colleague speak an uncomfortable truth in a meeting? Send them a private message of support. Moloch works by punishing defectors. Your job is to build a micro-economy—even if it's just social and reputational—that rewards them.

#### Level 3: Expand the Sanctuary (The Community)

This is where the arks get built. High-trust pairs and trios can now form high-trust groups.

*   **Action 7: Build or Join a "High-Trust" Group.** This can be anything: a book club, a makerspace, a church group, an open-source project, a D&D campaign, a sports team. What matters is that it's a group where the primary currency is reputation and trust, not short-term, zero-sum victory. In these spaces, we practice the rules of the world we *want* to live in. We build social capital that we can then "spend" on bigger projects.
*   **Action 8: Choose Your Arena.** You can't escape competition, but you can choose where you compete. Deliberately choose to compete in games where the competition itself produces a positive externality. Compete to be the most generous person in your friend group. Compete with your gym buddy to be healthier. Compete with a colleague to see who can mentor more junior employees. Shift your competitive drive away from Moloch's games and into games that build people up, including yourself.

---

This is the path. It starts with the radical act of taking full responsibility for your own soul, then finding one or two others who are doing the same. These high-trust pockets are the seeds from which a better world can grow. They are the sanctuaries where humanity can shelter while the storm of Moloch rages outside. They are the lifeboats.

You don't fight the demon. You make the demon irrelevant by building a world it cannot touch.
