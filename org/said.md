# SAID

Four feelings that drive human motivation and engagement.

## The Framework

- **S**ignificant - Your work matters, makes a difference
- **A**ppreciated - Recognized for your contributions
- **I**nvested - Your growth is being cultivated
- **D**epended - Others rely on you, trust you with responsibility

## Why It Works

These represent intrinsic motivators deeper than titles or salary. Missing any one creates a leak in engagement.

## Using SAID

As a leader: Check that your team feels each of these regularly.

For yourself: Notice which one you need most right now.
