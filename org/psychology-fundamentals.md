# Psychology Fundamentals

Core concepts in human psychology - cognition, motivation, emotion, behavior change, and decision-making.

**Related:** [[learning-psychology]] for learning science | [[make-it-stick]] for study techniques | [[supercommunicators]] for social psychology | [[engagement]] for motivation in teams

## Philosophy

Psychology is the science of mind and behavior. Understanding psychological principles helps us:
- Make better decisions (avoid cognitive biases)
- Change habits effectively (behavior change science)
- Motivate ourselves and others (intrinsic vs extrinsic)
- Manage emotions (emotional regulation)
- Communicate effectively (social cognition)
- Learn more efficiently (metacognition)

**Key insight:** Humans are not rational actors. We are predictably irrational, influenced by emotions, social context, cognitive shortcuts, and unconscious processes.

## Cognitive Psychology

### Mental Models

Mental models are how we understand the world - internal representations of external reality.

**Characteristics:**
- **Simplified abstractions** - Never complete, always lossy
- **Pattern-based** - We match new situations to known patterns
- **Resistant to change** - Confirmation bias protects existing models
- **Multiple simultaneous** - Different contexts activate different models

**Practical implications:**
- Teaching requires changing mental models, not just transmitting facts
- Debugging requires examining your model of how the system works
- Conflicts often stem from different mental models, not different facts

**Example:** A programmer's mental model of "variable" evolves from "box containing value" → "name bound to value" → "reference to memory location" → "symbol in environment mapping"

### Cognitive Biases

Systematic patterns of deviation from rationality.

**Confirmation Bias:**
- Seek information that confirms existing beliefs
- Dismiss contradictory evidence
- **Counter:** Actively seek disconfirming evidence; ask "what would change my mind?"

**Availability Heuristic:**
- Judge probability by ease of recall
- Recent/vivid events feel more probable
- **Example:** Fear of plane crashes > car crashes (despite statistics)
- **Counter:** Look at base rates, not memorable instances

**Anchoring:**
- First number you see influences subsequent estimates
- **Example:** "Is the population of Turkey > 35 million?" biases your estimate upward
- **Counter:** Generate multiple independent estimates before anchoring

**Sunk Cost Fallacy:**
- Continue investing because of past investment, not future value
- **Example:** Finishing a bad movie because you paid for it
- **Counter:** Only consider future costs/benefits, ignore sunk costs

**Dunning-Kruger Effect:**
- Low-skill individuals overestimate their competence
- High-skill individuals underestimate their competence
- **Reason:** Skill required to recognize incompetence is the same skill you lack
- **Counter:** Actively seek feedback; measure performance objectively

**Planning Fallacy:**
- Underestimate time/cost/difficulty of future tasks
- **Reason:** Optimism bias + ignoring base rates
- **Counter:** Reference class forecasting (how long did similar tasks take?)

### Working Memory

**Capacity:** ~4 chunks (Miller's 7±2 is outdated)
- **Chunking:** Group information into larger units
- **Example:** Remember phone number as 3 chunks (415-867-5309) not 10 digits

**Implications:**
- Cognitive load matters - reduce unnecessary information
- External tools (notes, diagrams) offload working memory
- Multitasking = rapid context switching with high overhead

**Cognitive Load Theory:**
1. **Intrinsic load** - Inherent complexity of material
2. **Extraneous load** - Poor presentation/instruction
3. **Germane load** - Mental effort building schemas

**Goal:** Minimize extraneous load, manage intrinsic load, maximize germane load

### Attention

**Selective attention:**
- Focus on some stimuli, filter out others
- **Famous experiment:** Count basketball passes, miss gorilla
- **Implication:** Divided attention reduces performance significantly

**Attention is limited:**
- Flow state = fully absorbed, no attention left for distractions
- Notifications destroy flow (23 min to recover focus after interruption)
- **Strategy:** Time-blocking, do not disturb mode, batch communications

## Motivation

### Intrinsic vs Extrinsic

**Intrinsic motivation:**
- Doing activity for inherent satisfaction
- Examples: curiosity, mastery, autonomy, purpose
- **Durable and sustainable**

**Extrinsic motivation:**
- Doing activity for external reward/punishment
- Examples: money, grades, recognition, avoiding pain
- **Effective short-term, can undermine intrinsic motivation**

**Overjustification effect:**
- Adding extrinsic rewards to intrinsically motivated activity can reduce intrinsic motivation
- **Example:** Paying kids to read → they read less when payment stops

### Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

Three psychological needs for intrinsic motivation:

**1. Autonomy** - Control over your actions
- Choice in how to accomplish goals
- Volition, not coercion
- **Example:** Choose your own tasks vs assigned tasks

**2. Competence** - Feeling effective and capable
- Challenges matched to skill level (flow zone)
- Clear feedback on progress
- **Example:** Leveling up, mastery experiences

**3. Relatedness** - Connection to others
- Sense of belonging
- Contributing to something larger
- **Example:** Team projects, community involvement

**Implication:** Optimize for these three needs to maximize intrinsic motivation.

### Growth vs Fixed Mindset

**Fixed mindset:**
- Intelligence/talent is static
- Failure reflects lack of ability
- Avoid challenges to maintain self-image
- **Result:** Fragile motivation, gives up easily

**Growth mindset:**
- Intelligence/talent can be developed
- Failure is opportunity to learn
- Embrace challenges
- **Result:** Resilient motivation, persistence

**How to cultivate:**
- Praise effort/strategy, not innate ability
- Frame setbacks as learning opportunities
- Emphasize "not yet" instead of "can't"

### Goal Setting

**SMART goals:**
- **S**pecific - Clear, unambiguous
- **M**easurable - Track progress objectively
- **A**chievable - Realistic given constraints
- **R**elevant - Aligned with larger objectives
- **T**ime-bound - Deadline creates urgency

**Process vs outcome goals:**
- **Outcome:** "Lose 20 pounds" (less controllable)
- **Process:** "Exercise 4x/week" (more controllable)
- **Recommendation:** Focus on process goals, use outcome goals for direction

**Implementation intentions:**
- "If X happens, I will do Y"
- **Example:** "If it's 7am, I will put on running shoes"
- Removes decision-making in the moment

## Emotion

### Emotional Regulation

Strategies to influence which emotions you experience, when, and how you express them.

**1. Situation Selection** - Choose situations that promote desired emotions
- Avoid triggering contexts when possible
- **Example:** Don't grocery shop when hungry

**2. Situation Modification** - Change the situation
- **Example:** Leave the room during heated argument, return when calm

**3. Attentional Deployment** - Direct attention elsewhere
- Distraction (short-term relief)
- Mindfulness (observe emotion without judgment)

**4. Cognitive Reappraisal** - Reinterpret meaning
- **Example:** Nervousness → excitement (same physiological state)
- Most effective long-term strategy

**5. Response Modulation** - Suppress/enhance expression
- Least effective (high cognitive cost)
- **Example:** "Fake it till you make it" has limited efficacy

### Stress Response

**Acute stress (fight-or-flight):**
- Physiological: ↑ heart rate, cortisol, adrenaline
- Cognitive: Narrow focus, fast decisions, reduced creativity
- **Adaptive for immediate threats**

**Chronic stress:**
- Prolonged activation damages health
- ↓ immune function, ↑ inflammation, ↓ cognitive performance
- **Maladaptive in modern environment**

**Stress management:**
- **Exercise** - Metabolize stress hormones
- **Sleep** - Restore cognitive function
- **Social support** - Buffering effect
- **Mindfulness** - Reduce rumination
- **Control** - Autonomy reduces stress

### Emotional Intelligence (EI)

**Four components:**
1. **Self-awareness** - Recognize your emotions
2. **Self-management** - Regulate your emotions
3. **Social awareness** - Recognize others' emotions (empathy)
4. **Relationship management** - Use emotional knowledge to guide interactions

**Why it matters:**
- Predicts job performance (especially leadership roles)
- Better relationships and communication
- Resilience under stress

## Behavior Change

### Habit Formation

**Habit loop (Duhigg):**
1. **Cue** - Trigger that initiates behavior
2. **Routine** - Behavior itself
3. **Reward** - Benefit that reinforces behavior

**To build new habit:**
- Make cue obvious (visual reminders)
- Make routine easy (reduce friction)
- Make reward satisfying (immediate gratification)
- **Habit stacking:** "After [existing habit], I will [new habit]"

**To break bad habit:**
- Remove cue (change environment)
- Increase friction (add barriers)
- Replace routine (keep cue/reward, change behavior)

**Timeline:**
- Simple habits: ~21 days
- Complex habits: ~66 days average (wide variation)
- **Key:** Consistency matters more than perfection

### Behavior Change Models

**COM-B Model:**
- **Capability** - Do you have the skill/knowledge?
- **Opportunity** - Is the environment conducive?
- **Motivation** - Do you want to do it?

All three required for behavior change.

**Stages of Change (Transtheoretical Model):**
1. **Precontemplation** - Not considering change
2. **Contemplation** - Thinking about change
3. **Preparation** - Planning to change
4. **Action** - Actively changing
5. **Maintenance** - Sustaining change

**Implication:** Different interventions work at different stages.

### Self-Control & Willpower

**Ego depletion (controversial):**
- Original theory: Self-control is limited resource that depletes
- Replication crisis: Effect size smaller than thought, may not exist
- **Practical takeaway:** Whether or not willpower is limited, environment design > willpower

**Implementation strategies:**
- **Reduce decisions** - Automate routine choices (same breakfast daily)
- **Environment design** - Make desired behavior default
- **Precommitment** - Restrict future options (delete social media apps)

## Decision Making

### Dual Process Theory

**System 1 (Fast):**
- Automatic, unconscious, effortless
- Pattern matching, heuristics
- Emotional, intuitive
- **Strengths:** Fast, good for familiar situations
- **Weaknesses:** Prone to biases

**System 2 (Slow):**
- Controlled, conscious, effortful
- Logical reasoning, calculation
- Rational, deliberate
- **Strengths:** Accurate for novel/complex problems
- **Weaknesses:** Slow, cognitively demanding

**When to use which:**
- System 1 for routine, low-stakes decisions
- System 2 for important, novel, counterintuitive decisions
- **Problem:** System 1 often answers easier question than you asked

### Satisficing vs Maximizing

**Satisficing:**
- Choose first option that meets criteria
- "Good enough"
- **Result:** Faster decisions, higher satisfaction

**Maximizing:**
- Exhaustively search for best option
- Optimize everything
- **Result:** Better outcomes, lower satisfaction (regret, opportunity cost)

**Paradox of choice:**
- More options → harder to decide → less satisfied with choice
- **Strategy:** Limit options, satisfice for low-stakes decisions

### Decision Frameworks

**Expected Value:**
- Multiply probability by outcome for each option
- Choose highest expected value
- **Good for:** Repeated decisions, quantifiable outcomes

**Regret Minimization:**
- Imagine yourself at 80, looking back - which choice minimizes regret?
- **Good for:** Major life decisions (career, relationships)

**10/10/10 Rule:**
- How will you feel about this decision in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years?
- **Good for:** Balancing short-term and long-term consequences

**Pre-mortem:**
- Imagine project failed - what went wrong?
- Identify risks before committing
- **Good for:** Planning, risk mitigation

## Social Psychology

### Social Influence

**Conformity:**
- Change behavior to match group norms
- **Asch experiment:** 75% conformed to obviously wrong answer
- **Stronger when:** Ambiguous situation, unanimous group, high status group

**Obedience:**
- Follow orders from authority figure
- **Milgram experiment:** 65% delivered "lethal" shock when instructed
- **Factors:** Proximity to authority, distance from victim, institutional legitimacy

**Groupthink:**
- Desire for harmony → poor decisions
- Suppress dissent, ignore alternatives, illusion of invulnerability
- **Counter:** Assign devil's advocate, encourage disagreement, leader withholds opinion

### Attribution Theory

How we explain behavior (ours vs others).

**Fundamental attribution error:**
- Overestimate personality, underestimate situation for *others*' behavior
- **Example:** "They're rude" vs "I'm having a bad day"

**Self-serving bias:**
- Attribute successes to self, failures to external factors
- **Example:** Good grade = I'm smart; Bad grade = Test was unfair

**Actor-observer bias:**
- My behavior = situational; Your behavior = dispositional

### Persuasion

**Cialdini's Six Principles:**

1. **Reciprocity** - People return favors
   - Give value first, ask later

2. **Commitment & Consistency** - People align with past actions
   - Start with small commitment, escalate

3. **Social Proof** - People follow others' lead
   - Show what others are doing

4. **Authority** - People defer to experts
   - Demonstrate expertise/credentials

5. **Liking** - People say yes to those they like
   - Build rapport, find commonalities

6. **Scarcity** - People want what's rare/limited
   - Emphasize uniqueness/limited availability

## Memory

### Types of Memory

**Sensory Memory** - Brief (<1 sec), high capacity
- Iconic (visual), echoic (auditory)

**Short-Term/Working Memory** - 15-30 sec, 4 chunks
- Active processing

**Long-Term Memory** - Unlimited duration, unlimited capacity
- **Declarative (explicit):**
  - Episodic: Personal experiences
  - Semantic: Facts, concepts
- **Non-declarative (implicit):**
  - Procedural: Skills (riding bike)
  - Priming: Unconscious influence

### How Memory Works

**Encoding:**
- Transfer from working to long-term memory
- **Depth of processing:** Deeper processing = better retention
  - Shallow: Visual/phonetic features
  - Deep: Meaning, connections to existing knowledge

**Storage:**
- Consolidation strengthens memories over time
- Sleep crucial for consolidation
- **Reconsolidation:** Retrieving memory makes it temporarily malleable

**Retrieval:**
- Accessing stored information
- **Context-dependent:** Easier to recall in same context as encoding
- **State-dependent:** Easier to recall in same emotional/physiological state

### Forgetting

**Why we forget:**
- **Decay** - Memories fade over time (if not retrieved)
- **Interference** - New learning interferes with old (retroactive) or vice versa (proactive)
- **Retrieval failure** - Information is there but can't access it

**Forgetting curve (Ebbinghaus):**
- Steep drop initially (50% in 1 hour)
- Levels off over time
- **Spaced repetition combats forgetting curve**

## Practical Applications

### For Learning
- Use retrieval practice (see [[make-it-stick]])
- Space repetition over time
- Build on existing knowledge (schemas)
- Test yourself before feeling ready

### For Decision Making
- Recognize cognitive biases
- Use System 2 for important decisions
- Seek disconfirming evidence
- Pre-commit to reduce future temptation

### For Motivation
- Optimize for autonomy, competence, relatedness
- Focus on process goals
- Cultivate growth mindset
- Use implementation intentions

### For Habit Change
- Identify cue-routine-reward loop
- Modify environment to support desired behavior
- Start small, build consistency
- Stack new habits on existing ones

### For Communication
- Understand attribution errors (you vs them)
- Use emotional intelligence
- Apply persuasion principles ethically
- Recognize social influence

## Common Misconceptions

**"Learning styles" (visual/auditory/kinesthetic):**
- No evidence supporting tailored instruction by learning style
- **Reality:** Use multiple modalities for everyone

**"Left-brain/right-brain":**
- Oversimplification; both hemispheres work together
- **Reality:** Distributed processing across brain regions

**"We only use 10% of our brain":**
- Completely false
- **Reality:** We use all of our brain, just not all at once

**"Multitasking is efficient":**
- Task switching has high overhead
- **Reality:** Focus on one task at a time

**"Memory is like video recording":**
- Memory is reconstructive, not reproductive
- **Reality:** We reconstruct memories each time we recall them
