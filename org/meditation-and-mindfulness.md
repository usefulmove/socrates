# “The 3 Essential Practices”**

## **1. Meditative Practice (Vipassana)**

**Purpose:** Train attention, calm the mind, see clearly.
**How to do it:**

1. **Attend to raw sensations** (not the world “through” sensations).

   * Example: feel the expansion and contraction of your abdomen while breathing.

2. **When the mind wanders**, don’t follow the content.

   * Instead, **label the process** with an **-ing** word:
     *planning, imagining, listening, remembering…*

3. **Return to the breath with the right attitude:**

   * Don’t fight the “monkey mind” → trains fear/anger.
   * Don’t indulge it → trains distraction.
   * **Befriend it.** Gentle, steady return.

**The actionable cycle:**
*Feel sensation → mind wanders → label → return → repeat kindly.*

#  **2. Contemplative Practice (Metta / existential interpretation)**

**Purpose:** Become aware of how you assign identity — to yourself and others — and loosen rigid modes of being.

**What to do:**

* Notice how you're **assuming an identity** (“I am the type of person who…”)
* Notice how you’re **assigning identities to others** (“You are the kind of person who…”)
* “Awaken to” those assumptions and “awaken from” the confusion they create.

It’s not about generating emotions; it’s about **changing your mode of seeing**.

**Concrete exercise offered:**
**Stoic “View From Above.”**

1. Visualize yourself in the room.
2. Then above the room.
3. Then above the city.
4. Then state → country → Earth → wider and wider.
5. *Actually* imagine it, don’t jump steps.

As you zoom out, your felt sense of self and what matters shifts.
This shift is the practice.

#  **3. Moving Mindfulness Practice (Flow-inducing movement)**

**Purpose:** Bring awareness into the body through movement; induce flow; integrate mind + body.
**Examples:**

* Tai Chi Chuan
* Qi Gong
* Any mindful, slow, deliberate movement practice

**How to do it:**
Choose a movement discipline that requires continuous, embodied attention and practice it regularly.

#  **Integrate the Three**

The real power is in **practicing all three together**, not as isolated techniques:

* **Meditation** → stabilizes attention
* **Contemplation** → reframes identity + worldview
* **Movement** → embodied awareness + flow

Together they create a unified transformation.
