## Lean Six Sigma

**DMAIC**

1. Define
2. Measure
3. Analyze
4. Improve
5. Control

**Lean**
****Lean methodology is about the removal of waste within an operation. Lean Manufacturing methodology recognizes nine types of waste: defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, and non-utilized talent. **Kanban** boards and **5S** are core principles of the Lean methodology.

**5S**

1. Sort: Remove items not needed.
2. Set in order: Arrange items so that they are easy to use. Label them so that anyone can find them or put them away.
3. Shine: Clean your workspace every day. Keep everything in the correct place.
4. Standardize: Perform the process the same way every time.
5. Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in the team.

**Kanban**
Kanban is a visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your team's work. It gives the team a visual display to identify what needs to be done and when. The Kanban board uses cards that are moved from left to right to show progress and coordinate the work.

**Six Sigma**
Six Sigma is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time.

The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:

1. Always focus on the customer.
2. Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
3. Make your processes flow smoothly.
4. Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
5. Stop defects by removing variation.
6. Involve and collaborate with our team.
7. Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.

Use this methodology to find aspects of the product or process that are measurable like time, cost, or quantity. Then inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard. Any process that created unacceptable products has to be improved upon.

**Lean Six Sigma**
After both Lean and Six Sigma were put into practice, it was discovered that the two methodologies could be combined to increase benefits. The tools used in Lean build quality in processes from the beginning. Products developed using Lean methods are then inspected or tested using Six Sigma standards. The products that do not meet these standards are rejected.

## **Popular project management approaches**


- **Waterfall** is a traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.
- **Agile** involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.
- **Scrum** focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex project and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Like many Agile frameworks, work is often completed by smaller, cross-functional teams and divided into short “Sprints” with a set list of deliverables.
- **Kanban** is both an approach and a tool that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”
- **Lean** focuses on efficiency, applying core principles to maximize value and minimize waste. Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste.
- **Six Sigma** involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.
- **Lean Six Sigma** is a combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches. It uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes. Lean Six Sigma uses Kanban boards to manage production and is ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems.

## Project Initiation (Phase I)

Consider:

- Goals
    - Purpose and mission
    - What are we trying to improve?
    - What are the benefits?
- Scope
- Deliverables
- Success criteria
    - Measurable objectives
    - When does this project need to be completed?
    - What will the project cost?
- Stakeholders
- Resources
    - What skills and resources will the project require?


**Project Charter**
A document that clearly defines the project and its goals and outlines what is needed to accomplish them


**Cost-Benefit Analysis**
Adding up the expected value of a project and comparing them to the dollar costs. A cost-benefit analysis can help communicate with stakeholders and executives and keep the project on track. It can help reduce biases and keep stakeholder self-interest from influencing decisions. Comparing a project's benefits to its costs can help make a strong business case and ensure the organization pursues the most profitable or useful projects. Organizations use cost-benefit analyses to reduce waste and invest resources responsibly. Calculating costs and benefits is also called calculating return on investment (ROI).

To determine the benefits, you might ask:
What value will this project create?
How much money could this project save our organization?
How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
How much time will it save?
How will it improve the customer experience?
Are there intangible benefits, such as customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, employee productivity or brand perception?

To determine the costs, consider questions such as:
How much time will people have to spend on this project?
What are the one-time costs?
Are there any ongoing costs?
What about the long-term costs?
Are there intangible costs?

Return on Investment (ROI)
(G-C) ÷ C = ROI

# Objectives and Key Results: Building and implementing OKRs

In this lesson, you are learning to define and create measurable project goals and deliverables. As we continue our understanding of project management and the different tools available to help us succeed, let’s focus here on the function and benefits of **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** and how to implement them across an organization.

OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a ****measurable outcome.


- The **objective**, or goal, portion of the OKR defines what needs to be achieved. It describes a desired outcome, such as an increase in customer retention or an improvement in the employee onboarding process.
- The **key** **results**, or metric, part of the OKR defines how you will tangibly measure the success of your initiatives. It describes the standards of measurement that capture the efficacy, performance, or quality of your objective, such as amount of revenue earned or a number of units sold.

OKRs are a common measurement tool used in organizations at the company level, team level, and even at the product or project level. OKRs are shared across the organization so that all teams have a clear understanding of the company’s goals and can align and focus their efforts to help the company reach those goals. For instance, project managers will often reference company-wide OKRs when setting their individual project OKRs in an attempt to align and bridge a connection. 
OKRs are popular because they provide a path for clear, actionable goals. There are five major benefits for OKRs, which make up the acronym FACTS:

| **Focus**      | OKRs provide focus. They help zoom in on the few important initiatives that can make an immediate, consequential difference while postponing less urgent ones.            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alignment**  | OKRs create transparency amongst teams, organizations, and even managers and their direct reports. OKRs are typically documented and shared with everyone for visibility. |
| **Commitment** | OKRs serve as a social contract between teams, individuals, and the organization.                                                                                         |
| **Tracking**   | OKRs can be tracked against the commitment to gauge performance.                                                                                                          |
| **Stretch**    | OKRs provide stretch opportunities and encourage individuals to challenge themselves to achieve a larger goal.                                                            |

## **Implementing OKRs across organizations**

Since OKRs are often implemented across an organization, they help all team members see the measurable objectives and key results of a company-wide initiative. They ensure that even the most junior employees understand how their focused effort can help the company achieve its goals.

As the project manager for a project with multiple teams and timelines but one overall goal, using OKRs can help you identify both your overarching needs and the deliverables you’ll need from each team member to fulfill the larger goals. You can use OKRs to help motivate your team since their goals can be both short- and long-term.

Within a company, you could have OKRs on the strategic, tactical, ****and operational ****levels: 


![Icons of strategic, tactical and operational  OKRs:](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/mBRsTTh7RqyUbE04e5asGw_acdd72954e084d858ed3d7a20285ac11_Google_Readings_Stills_PGM_B10.jpg?expiry=1620345600000&hmac=fQFHUiabGm0N8iOzZ3AVC-8scI9dxk3DKyHP69DYlGo)


**Strategic** (company-level)

OKRs are usually updated on an annual basis to help drive the organization in the direction it wants to go. These high-level OKRs support the mission and objectives of the organization.  

**Tactical** (mid-level)

OKRs may be updated on a quarterly basis to drive team performance and help define measurable goals to help meet quarterly objectives.  

**Operational** (low-level)

OKRs might be set on a monthly basis to help reach objectives and manage short-term operational performance.


## **Building purposeful OKRs**

When you build OKRs for a project, your aim is to determine the ***why***, ****the *******what***, and the ***how***. ****The *why* is the purpose. Why is your project significant? The *what* is the objective. What are you trying to accomplish? And the *how* is the key results. How are you going to accomplish your objective? 

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/l_IlbCkcSUeyJWwpHLlHbg_cf68bd94679c44d7a4ec83e8df5603b3_OKRs-C2M2L1R2.png?expiry=1620345600000&hmac=IG5hjfKIqOYX7bYWYFFwAdiXO7EaM3-cGQzL6nM-TA0)


The why is the purpose. Why is your project significant? The what is the objective. What are you trying to accomplish? And the how is the key results. How are you going to accomplish your objective?

When creating OKRs, you will follow these four essential steps:


1. **Define your purpose.** Identify the team’s mission.
2. **Build out your objective.** What are the project’s goals?
3. **Develop 2–3 key results for your objective.** How will you know when the objective has been met?
4. **Write 3–5 key initiatives that you will work towards to make progress on your OKRs.**

Let’s look at an example of an OKR at the company level:

**OBJECTIVE:** Improve employee satisfaction

**KEY RESULTS:**

- Maintain an employee retention rate of 80%
- Annual employee satisfaction survey score improves by 20%
- 50% of employees are actively participating in a mentorship program


In the example above, we have identified what our end goal or objective is “to improve our employee satisfaction” and then we have defined the key results that would indicate successfully meeting that goal.

Our key initiatives for this OKR might include:


- Launch a pilot of the mentorship program to 40 junior analysts and 20 senior managers.
- Build a feedback survey and reporting dashboard.
- Host three employee well-being sessions.



## **Communicating and tracking an OKR**

Since so many teams are involved in tracking OKRs, communication is key. Here are some key tips for maintaining clear communication when tracking OKRs:


- Establish the frequency with which you will check in with your team and senior managers on how your project is performing against the OKRs you set. Choose a cadence that makes sense for your team. For example, for operational OKRs with a team, you may want to check in weekly. For tactical OKRs of an area, you may want to check in biweekly or monthly. For strategic OKRs for your company, you may want to check in quarterly.
- Formalize this process. ****For instance, build your OKRs at the end of each quarter for the upcoming quarter. Then, execute your OKRs and score ****how you measured up against them at the end of that quarter.
- Scoring your OKRs is an important part of the cycle to track and share your progress. Define how your OKRs will be scored. For example, will you use a percentage of the objective complete to determine your score? Will you score based on the completion of certain milestones? Will you use traffic lights (red, yellow, green) to score OKRs? (For example, did you clearly achieve the objective? Green. Did you fail? Red. Were you in the middle? Yellow.) From here, you can prioritize what you need to focus on in the future to improve.

Responsible: Assigned to complete the task or deliverable
Accountable: Has final decision-making authority and accountability for completion (only one per task)
Consulted: Must be consulted before a decision or action is taken
Informed: Must be informed after a decision or action is taken

Use roles, rather than names, because some members may have more than one role on a project.

Maintaining workload balance is a critical part of project management. It is easy to fall into the pattern of relying on your top performers to keep the project moving forward. But this isn’t always healthy for the project or your team. If you find that you don’t have the right people to assign responsibilities to, take a step back and evaluate your team.

##  Project Charter

 Project charters vary, but usually include some combination of the following information:

- introduction/project summary
- goals/objectives 
- business case/benefits and costs
- project team
- scope
- success criteria
- major requirements or key deliverables
- budget
- schedule/timeline or milestones
- constraints and assumptions
- risks
- OKRs
- approvals
