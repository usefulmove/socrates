Supercommunicators by Charles Duhigg


"Do you want to be helped, hugged, or heard?"


Three Types of Conversation
1. What is this really about?
2. How do we feel?
3. Who are we?


Connecting Questions:

- your beliefs and values?
- experiences that caused you to change?
- how do you feel?


Listening - letting a person get their story out and trying to understand ( even if you disagree ) why they believe what they believe and feel the way they feel
