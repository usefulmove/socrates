Supercommunicators by Charles Duhigg


"Do you want to be helped, hugged, or heard?"


Three Types of Conversation
1. What is this really about?
2. How do we feel?
3. Who are we?


Connecting Questions:
- What are your beliefs and values?
- What are some experiences that caused you to change?
- How do you feel about . . . ?


Listening - letting a person get their story out and trying to understand ( even if you disagree ) why they believe what they believe and feel the way they feel


Ask open-ended questions.


Framework for Difficult Discussions:
- Everyone is allowed to talk, but no shaming, blaming or attacks.
- You have to think before you speak.
- You have to contribute, rather than just criticize.


Loop for understanding.
- (ask) Ask a question that gives the person a chance to open up and share their feelings.
- (paraphrase) Paraphrase what they say to prove that you were listening.
- (verify) Verify that your summary was accurate. "Does that sound right?" "Am I close?"
