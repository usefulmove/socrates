# How to Handle Criticism

## Immediate Response

**When criticism comes in:**
- Pause for 3-5 seconds before responding
- Breathe: inhale 4 counts, exhale 6 counts
- Reframe: "This is data for growth, not judgment"
- Listen completely before defending

**Don't:**
- React emotionally or get defensive
- Interrupt or justify
- Suppress emotions (suppress nothing, just delay response)

---

## Distinguish: Helpful vs. Harmful

**Act on feedback that is:**
- Specific and actionable
- Focused on behaviors, not character
- Supported by examples
- Comes from someone with expertise or good intent

**Dismiss feedback that is:**
- Vague or personal attacks
- From unreliable sources
- Contradicts your values
- Delivered disrespectfully without dialogue

---

## In the Moment

**Listen:**
- Take notes (shows engagement, helps processing)
- Use non-verbal cues (nod, maintain eye contact)

**Ask:**
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What would you like me to do differently?"

**Acknowledge:**
- "Thank you for sharing this"
- "I appreciate your honesty"

## Response Scripts

**Accepting:**
> "I hear you. I'm going to [specific action] and check back with you in [timeframe]."

**Needing clarification:**
> "I want to understand. Can you give me a specific example?"

**Disagreeing respectfully:**
> "I appreciate your perspective. I see it differently because [reasoning]. Can we discuss how to move forward?"

**Setting boundaries:**
> "I'm open to feedback, but I need it to be respectful. Can we restart this conversation?"

**Taking time:**
> "I need to reflect on this. Can we revisit this tomorrow?"

## After Receiving Criticism

**Within 24 hours:**
- Process emotions when calm
- Determine what has merit
- Create 2-3 specific action items
- Schedule follow-up if appropriate

**Action template:**
```
Feedback: [What was said]
Action: [Specific change]
Timeline: [When you'll implement]
Follow-up: [When you'll check in]
```

## When to Act vs. Dismiss

**Act when:**
- Multiple sources confirm the same issue
- It aligns with your values
- The source has credibility
- You can verify the facts

**Dismiss when:**
- No supporting evidence
- Suspect motives (jealousy, control)
- You can't verify the claims
- You're too emotional to evaluate fairly

**Use the 24-hour rule:** Don't respond to significant criticism immediately. Process overnight.

## Building Resilience

**Proactive habits:**
- Seek feedback regularly ("What's one thing I could do better?")
- Build a personal board of 3-5 trusted advisors
- Prioritize sleep (poor sleep impairs emotional regulation)
- Document feedback themes to identify patterns
