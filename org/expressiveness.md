Expressiveness in programming languages and programming paradigms refers to the ability of a language to clearly, concisely, and efficiently express algorithms and computational concepts. It encompasses several factors:

1. **Syntax and Semantics**: A language is considered expressive if it has a syntax that makes it easy to write and read code, paired with semantics that are straightforward and align closely with the programmer's mental model of how the code should function.

2. **Abstraction Capabilities**: An expressive language often provides powerful abstraction mechanisms, such as functions, classes, and modules, which allow developers to encapsulate complex behavior in a simple and reusable way.

3. **Brevity**: The ability of a language to perform complex operations with fewer lines of code can also be a measure of its expressiveness. This includes features like list comprehensions, lambda functions, and pattern matching, which can make code more concise and intuitive.

4. **Flexibility**: Expressive languages typically offer multiple ways to solve a problem, including procedural, object-oriented, functional, or even declarative paradigms, giving programmers the flexibility to choose the most natural or efficient approach.

5. **Type System**: The sophistication of a language's type system can also affect its expressiveness. Strong typing can enforce constraints that prevent errors and make the program's intentions clearer, while dynamic typing can reduce verbosity and increase flexibility.

6. **Standard Library and Tooling**: The richness of a language's standard library and the quality of its tooling can enhance its expressiveness by making common programming tasks easier and more intuitive.

In essence, expressiveness is about how well a programming language or paradigm enables programmers to implement ideas directly and naturally, making it easier to translate thought processes into working code.
