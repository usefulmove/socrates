# Engagement

## The AMPR Framework

Four factors drive engagement:

- **Autonomy**: Control over how you do your work
- **Mastery**: Progress toward getting better at something meaningful  
- **Purpose**: Making a valued contribution
- **Relatedness**: Connection with others

**Note**: Job security and financial concerns must be addressed first. It's hard to care about autonomy when you're worried about rent.

**Sources**: "Carrots and Sticks Don't Work" and "Trillion Dollar Coach"

## Why This Matters

Most management advice focuses on motivation through external rewards: bonuses, promotions, perks. But these create compliance, not engagement.

Engagement comes from internal drivers. When work satisfies autonomy, mastery, purpose, and relatedness, people bring their full selves—creativity, initiative, persistence. When work violates these factors, people do the minimum to collect a paycheck.

The difference isn't marginal. Engaged people solve problems you didn't know existed. Disengaged people wait to be told what to do.

## Autonomy

### What It Is

Autonomy is not independence or lack of constraints. It's having control over how you achieve the outcome.

- **Low autonomy**: "Implement this solution exactly as specified"
- **High autonomy**: "We need to solve X. Here are the constraints. Figure out how."

Autonomy respects that adults can make decisions about how to do their work.

### Why It Matters

Without autonomy, you're treating people as code execution machines. Input requirements, output code. This might work for junior engineers on well-defined tasks, but it breaks down everywhere else:

- Senior engineers have context and judgment that specs can't capture
- Creative work requires trying approaches that might fail
- Learning requires autonomy to experiment
- Ownership requires autonomy to make decisions

### How It's Violated

**Micromanagement**: Dictating not just what but how. Reviewing every decision. Requiring approval for trivial choices.

**Process over judgment**: So many processes and approvals that there's no room for independent decision-making.

**False autonomy**: "You have autonomy... to do exactly what I already decided." Autonomy theater.

### How to Create It

**Delegate outcomes, not tasks**: "Improve deployment reliability" vs "Add these specific monitoring checks"

**Set constraints, not methods**: "Needs to handle 10K requests/sec, under $500/month" vs "Use this specific architecture"

**Trust by default**: Assume people can make good decisions. Review exceptions, don't require pre-approval.

**Let people own their domain**: The person doing the work knows more about the details than you do. Let them make the calls.

### The Limits

Autonomy has boundaries:
- Company values (non-negotiable)
- Strategic direction (set by leadership)
- Technical standards (consistency matters)
- Budget and timeline constraints

The art is maximizing autonomy within these constraints, not pretending constraints don't exist.

## Mastery

### What It Is

Mastery is the experience of getting better at something that matters. Not just doing the same thing repeatedly, but progressively increasing capability.

This is why we enjoy video games, sports, musical instruments—they provide clear feedback on improvement.

### Why It Matters

Humans are growth-seeking. We're dissatisfied with stagnation. Mastery is the feeling that your effort translates into capability.

Without mastery, work becomes monotonous. You're doing the same thing over and over, not learning, not growing. This is soul-crushing for ambitious people.

### How It's Violated

**Stagnation**: Doing the same tasks with no growth. The IC who's been writing CRUD apps for five years with no complexity increase.

**No feedback**: Working without knowing whether you're improving. No code review, no mentorship, no measurement.

**Growth prevented**: Wanting to take on stretch work but being told to "stay in your lane." Blocked from learning new skills.

**Mismatched challenges**: Work that's either too hard (overwhelming) or too easy (boring). Flow requires the sweet spot.

### How to Create It

**Stretch assignments**: Give people work slightly beyond their current capability. Not so far they fail, not so easy they coast.

**Feedback loops**: Code review, pair programming, retrospectives—ways to see what good looks like and where you're falling short.

**Learning time**: Explicit time for learning. Study groups, conference attendance, time to explore new technologies.

**Career conversations**: Regular discussion about where someone wants to grow and how current work supports that.

**Visible progress**: Metrics, portfolio, achievements that show tangible improvement over time.

### The Paradox

Mastery requires both challenge and support. Too much challenge without support creates anxiety. Too much support without challenge creates boredom.

The manager's job is calibrating this for each person—what's stretching for a junior is routine for a senior.

## Purpose

### What It Is

Purpose is the sense that your work matters. Not just "we're making money" but "we're solving a problem that's worth solving."

This doesn't require saving the world. It requires believing that what you're building has value.

### Why It Matters

Humans need meaning. We'll tolerate a lot of difficulty if we believe it's for something worthwhile. But trivial work done for no clear reason is demoralizing.

Purpose connects daily tasks to larger impact:
- This bug fix → users can complete their workflows
- This refactoring → team can move faster
- This feature → customers can solve their problem

### How It's Violated

**Unclear mission**: No one knows why the company exists or why this work matters.

**Wasted work**: Building features no one uses, attending meetings that accomplish nothing, creating reports no one reads.

**Misaligned values**: The stated purpose conflicts with observed behavior. "We care about users" but decisions optimize for metrics.

**Disconnection**: Engineers don't see the impact of their work. No customer contact, no usage data, no feedback loops.

### How to Create It

**Share the why**: Not just what we're building, but why it matters. Who it helps, what problem it solves.

**Connect to impact**: Show how the work affected users. Customer testimonials, usage metrics, support ticket reduction.

**Values alignment**: Make sure company values show up in decisions. If you say you value quality, don't pressure teams to cut corners.

**Autonomy around purpose**: Let people work on what they find meaningful. Side projects, 20% time, choosing features to own.

**Kill meaningless work**: Stop doing things that don't matter. Eliminate meetings, reports, processes that waste time without benefit.

### The Challenge

Purpose can't be faked. If the work genuinely doesn't matter, no amount of inspirational messaging will create meaning.

Sometimes the honest answer is: "This work is boring but necessary. It funds the meaningful work." That's better than pretending the boring work is changing the world.

## Relatedness

### What It Is

Relatedness is the feeling of being connected to others. Belonging to a team, being known, mattering to people you work with.

Humans are social. We want to be part of something larger than ourselves.

### Why It Matters

Work is more enjoyable with people you like. But relatedness is deeper than that—it's psychological safety, mutual support, shared identity.

Without relatedness:
- Work is isolating and lonely
- No one to celebrate wins with
- No support during difficulty
- No sense of collective achievement

With relatedness:
- Problems are shared, not carried alone
- Wins feel collective  
- Challenges create bonding
- Team identity becomes part of personal identity

### How It's Violated

**Isolation**: Remote work without intentional connection. Heads-down coding with no interaction.

**Competition over collaboration**: Stack ranking, forced distribution, zero-sum promotions. Everyone for themselves.

**Psychological unsafety**: Fear of judgment, ridicule, or punishment. People don't show vulnerability.

**Exclusion**: Cliques, in-groups and out-groups. Some people belong, others don't.

**No shared experience**: Everyone on separate projects, no collective goals, no team identity.

### How to Create It

**Team rituals**: Standups, retros, team lunches, game nights. Regular touchpoints that aren't just work.

**Shared goals**: Team-level objectives that require collaboration. Not just individual contributor metrics.

**Celebrate together**: Wins are team wins. Ship a feature? Whole team celebrates, not just the person who wrote the code.

**Vulnerability**: Leaders modeling openness, admitting mistakes, showing humanity. Permission to be real.

**Inclusion**: Actively bringing people in, noticing who's quiet, making space for different perspectives.

**Pair programming**: Work together, not just independently. Build relationship while building software.

### Remote Work Challenge

Relatedness is harder remote. Casual hallway conversations don't happen. Social connection requires intentionality.

Solutions:
- Virtual coffee chats (optional, informal)
- Team calls that aren't all business
- In-person offsites when possible
- Async social channels (not forcing everyone into Zoom all day)

## The Interplay

These four factors are not independent:

**Autonomy enables mastery**: Can't get better if you can't make decisions and learn from them.

**Mastery requires relatedness**: Learning is social. Feedback, mentorship, shared knowledge.

**Purpose gives direction to autonomy**: Without purpose, autonomy is just chaos. Purpose focuses the freedom.

**Relatedness amplifies purpose**: Shared mission creates team identity. We're solving this together.

The magic happens when all four are present. Any one factor missing creates problems:

- **No autonomy**: Compliance, not engagement
- **No mastery**: Stagnation, boredom
- **No purpose**: Meaninglessness, "why are we doing this?"
- **No relatedness**: Isolation, loneliness

## The Foundation: Safety

Before AMPR matters, basic needs must be met:

**Financial security**: Can people pay rent, support family? If not, engagement is impossible. They're in survival mode.

**Job security**: Constant layoff fear prevents engagement. Hard to invest when you might be gone tomorrow.

**Psychological safety**: Can people speak up without fear? Without this, autonomy and relatedness can't exist.

This is Maslow's hierarchy applied to work. You can't optimize engagement when people are worried about basic security.

## For Individual Contributors

If you're an IC, you have more control over engagement than you think:

**Autonomy**: Ask for outcomes instead of tasks. Propose how you'll solve it. Push back on micromanagement.

**Mastery**: Seek stretch work. Ask for feedback. Create learning time even if not given explicitly.

**Purpose**: Understand the why. Ask how your work impacts users. Connect your tasks to larger goals.

**Relatedness**: Initiate connections. Start pair programming. Organize team events. Be the person who reaches out.

You can't control everything, but you can influence your own engagement.

## For Leaders

Leaders shape engagement for others. Your job is creating conditions where AMPR can thrive:

**Autonomy**: Delegate outcomes. Trust by default. Give people ownership.

**Mastery**: Calibrate challenge. Provide feedback. Create learning opportunities.

**Purpose**: Communicate why. Show impact. Kill meaningless work.

**Relatedness**: Build psychological safety. Create team rituals. Model vulnerability.

The test: Would your team say these factors are present? Not "do you believe you're providing them" but "do they experience them"?

## The Limits of Engagement

Engagement is not:
- **A substitute for compensation**: People need to be paid fairly. Engagement doesn't replace money.
- **A way to avoid hard conversations**: Engaged people still need feedback, performance management, accountability.
- **Happiness**: Engagement includes challenge, frustration, struggle. It's not about being comfortable.

Engagement is deep investment in work that matters. That can include discomfort, disagreement, difficulty.

## Personal Reflection

Looking back over a 25-year career:

**Engaged moments**: Learning new domains, solving hard problems with great teams, seeing impact of work, growing from IC to leader. These were hard but energizing.

**Disengaged moments**: Political nonsense, meaningless process, unclear direction, isolated work, no growth. These were draining even when easy.

The difference wasn't difficulty. It was whether autonomy, mastery, purpose, and relatedness were present.

As a leader now, the question is: Am I creating the conditions I needed to be engaged? Or am I inadvertently violating them for others?
