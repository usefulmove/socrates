#+title: Transformer


To understand the Transformer, let's break it down a bit. In NLP, we often deal with sequences of words, like sentences or paragraphs. Earlier models, like RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) and LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory), processed these sequences in a linear order, like reading one word after another. While they were effective, they had some limitations, especially when dealing with long sequences.

The Transformer, on the other hand, uses a mechanism called "attention" to process words in parallel, which means it can handle multiple words at the same time. Think of it like having multiple eyes that can focus on different parts of a sentence all at once. This makes the Transformer much faster and better at understanding the relationships between words, even when they're far apart in the sequence.

The "attention" mechanism works by calculating a score for each pair of words in the sequence, which represents how relevant they are to each other. The higher the score, the more "attention" the model pays to that relationship. This is done through some complex math, but you can think of it like having a bunch of mini detectives inside the model, each investigating how words are related to each other.

Once the attention scores are calculated, they're used to create a new representation of the sequence, which helps the model understand the context better. This process can be repeated multiple times in a "multi-head attention" setup, where the model can focus on different aspects of the relationships between words.

In summary, "Attention is All You Need" introduced the Transformer model, which uses the attention mechanism to process words in parallel, making it faster and better at understanding language. It has become the foundation for many NLP models, including the one you're chatting with right now!
