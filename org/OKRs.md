# Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)
Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) are the means we use to coordinate the actions of people and teams to achieve collective goals.


## “Conservative goal setting stymies innovation.”

*John Doerr, Measure What Matters*

OKRs are used to coordinate priorities and milestones to help people stay focused on the most important goals. OKRs are aggressive, but possible - we don’t expect to hit all of them every time. (If we do, we’re not being aggressive enough.)


## OKR “Superpowers”
1. Focus and commit to priorities

    “It is our choices . . . that show who we really are, far more than our abilities.” J.K. Rowling

2. Align and connect teams

    “We don’t hire smart people to tell them what to do. We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.” Steve Jobs

3. Tracking and accountability

    “In God we trust; all others must bring data.” W. Edwards Deming

4. Stretch for amazing results

    "If you set your goal ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success." James Cameron


## OKR Culture (Essence)
- Ruthless intellectual honesty
- Disregard for self-interest
- Deep allegiance to the team


## “OKRs never cascade. OKRs align.”

*Felipe Castro*


## Good Objectives
- Concrete
- Action-oriented
- Significant
- Inspirational
- Unambiguous
- Provide clear value


## Good Key Results
- Advance Objective(s)
- Specific & time-bound
- Aggressive (yet realistic)
- Measurable and verifiable
- Describe outcomes, not activities


## Cross-functional OKRs

Cross-functional OKRs should include all groups who must participate materially in the achievement of the Objective. OKRs committing to each group’s contribution should appear in each group’s OKRs.

## OKR Potential Problems
- Loss of agility
- Lack of flexibility
- Marginalized contributors
- One-dimensional linkages


OKRs are better when not used for bonuses and when about 50% bottom-up (versus top-down).

[Andy Grove’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove)s legacy, “his most valuable and lasting management practice.”


## Andy Grove’s Basic OKR Hygiene
- Less is more.
- Set goals from the bottom up.
- No dictating.
- Stay flexible.
- Dare to fail.
- A tool, not a weapon.
- Be patient; be resolute.


## Structured, public goal setting (and tools)
- ... make everyone’s goals more visible.
- ... drive engagement.
- ... promote internal networking.
- ... save time, money and frustration.
