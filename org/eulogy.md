If you were lucky enough to know Duane, you knew a man who loved deeply, thought expansively, and moved through life with both a relentless curiosity and a quiet, unwavering integrity. He was a builder—not just of teams, ideas, and careers, though he did all of that with remarkable skill—but of trust, of connection, of meaning. Wherever he went, he made people feel seen, heard, and valued.

He was a leader, though he never led from above. He led from within—by showing up, by committing fully, by believing in others even when they didn’t yet believe in themselves. He built high-performing teams not because he cared about performance for its own sake, but because he knew what was possible when good people came together with a shared purpose. And he never forgot the simple truth at the heart of everything he did: It’s the people.

He was a student of the mind, of human nature, of love. He sat with his fears rather than running from them, always seeking to understand himself and others more deeply. His kindness was not soft—it was fierce, intentional, the kind that demanded honesty and growth. He lived in pursuit of truth, and when he found it, he had the rare courage to face it head-on.

To those he loved most, he was home. A presence that made the world feel safer, steadier. He loved without conditions or pretense. He loved through small acts of care—a hand on a shoulder, a knowing glance, the simple act of staying. He found joy in life’s quiet moments: a conversation by candlelight, the warmth of a shared silence, the way light hit a face just right. He understood that this—these fleeting, unguarded moments—was what life was really about.

He was not perfect, and he never pretended to be. But he never stopped trying to be better. To grow. To show up fully for the people and the world he cared about. And that is what made him unforgettable.

Duane was, above all else, present. With us, in this life, in a way that few people ever truly are. And though he is no longer here in body, he remains—woven into the lives he touched, the love he gave, the moments he made matter. He left behind no monuments, no grand declarations—only people who were better for having known him.

And what more, really, could any of us hope for?

Rest easy, my friend. You did it right.
