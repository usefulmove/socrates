# Difficult Conversations (CALMS method)

Use this simple framework you can memorize:

> **C.A.L.M.S.**
> **C**enter → **A**im → **L**isten → **M**irror → **S**ay what you need

---

## 1. **C – Center Yourself (Regulate First, Talk Second)**

**Mindset:**
“If I’m dysregulated, I’m dangerous to the conversation.”

**What to do (the 20% that matters):**

* **Pause before you enter.** Give yourself 30–60 seconds.
* **Regulate your body:**

  * 3 slow breaths: exhale longer than you inhale.
  * Relax jaw, shoulders, hands.
* **Name your intention to yourself:**

  * “My goal is understanding + a next step. Not ‘winning’.”
* **Decide one non-negotiable:**

  * e.g., “I won’t raise my voice,” or “I will not interrupt.”

**Sample self-talk:**

> “Okay, breathe. I want clarity and connection, not a victory lap.”

---

## 2. **A – Aim the Conversation (State Your Why Up Front)**

**Mindset:**
“If I don’t aim this, we’ll drift into blame.”

**What to do:**

* Start with a short, clear **purpose sentence**:

  * “I want to talk about X so we can Y.”
* Keep it **non-accusatory** and forward-looking.
* Avoid global attacks (“you always…”, “you never…”).
  Use **issue + impact**, not **identity**.

**Simple template:**

> “I want to talk about **[topic]** so we can **[desired outcome]**. Is now okay?”

**Examples:**

* “I want to talk about how our last project wrapped up so we can work together more smoothly next time.”
* “I want to talk about how I felt in our conversation yesterday so we don’t keep bumping into the same thing.”

---

## 3. **L – Listen First, Longer Than Feels Comfortable**

**Mindset:**
“People calm down when they feel heard, not when I’m right.”

**What to do (core techniques):**

* Ask **one opening question**, then **shut up**:

  * “Can you tell me how you’re seeing this?”
* Use **looping**:

  * They talk → you summarize → you ask, “Did I get that right?”
* Don’t argue with details while they’re venting. Capture the **thrust**:

  * “So the main thing is you felt blindsided by the deadline, yeah?”

**Mini script:**

> “Before I share my side, I want to understand yours.
> How are you seeing what happened?”

If you do just this—**listen and loop until they say “yes, that’s it”**—you’ve already unlocked most of the 80%.

---

## 4. **M – Mirror and Validate Feelings (Without Agreeing to the Story)**

**Mindset:**
“I can acknowledge your feelings without surrendering my perspective.”

**What to do:**

* **Name the feeling** you see:

  * “It sounds like you felt ignored / disrespected / overwhelmed.”
* **Normalize the reaction** (when honest):

  * “Given what you thought was happening, that makes sense.”
* Don’t say:

  * ❌ “You’re overreacting.”
  * ❌ “You shouldn’t feel that way.”
* You’re not agreeing with their facts. You’re saying:

  * “Your feelings are real and allowed.”

**Template:**

> “So you felt **[emotion]** because **[their key reason]**.
> I get why that would be really hard.”

This alone drops the emotional temperature fast.

---

## 5. **S – Say What You Need + Suggest a Next Step**

**Mindset:**
“Clarity is kindness. Vague resentment is not.”

**What to do:**

* Use **I-statements** for impact:

  * “When X happened, I felt Y, because Z.”
* Make **one concrete ask**, not ten:

  * “What I’d like going forward is…”
* Invite collaboration:

  * “How does that land for you?”
  * “What would make this workable for you?”

**Simple template (fill this in):**

> * **Fact/Behavior:** “When **[specific thing]** happened…”
> * **Impact:** “…I felt **[emotion]** because **[reason/impact]**.”
> * **Ask:** “Going forward, I’d like us to **[specific behavior/change]**.
>   What do you think?”

## Putting C.A.L.M.S. Together – One Example

**Scenario:**
A coworker repeatedly delivers their part of a project late, leaving you scrambling.

### Step 1 – Center

You pause before the meeting:

> *“Breathe. My goal is a sustainable way of working together, not to shame them. I will not raise my voice.”*

### Step 2 – Aim

You open with:

> “I want to talk about how our last couple of deadlines went so we can work together more smoothly going forward. Is now okay?”

### Step 3 – Listen

You invite their view:

> “Before I share my side, can you walk me through how you experienced the last project?”

They say they had shifting priorities, thought the deadline was flexible, felt pressured, etc. You loop:

> “So from your perspective, priorities changed a lot, you thought the deadline had wiggle room, and you felt like the pressure came out of nowhere. Did I get that right?”

They say, “Yeah, exactly.”

### Step 4 – Mirror & Validate

> “Okay, that makes sense. If I thought a deadline was flexible and then got urgent messages near the end, I’d feel pressured and frustrated too.”

### Step 5 – Say What You Need + Next Step

> “From my side, when your part came in late, I felt really stressed because I had to scramble and work extra hours to hit the final client deadline.
>
> Going forward, what I’d like is:
>
> * If your priorities change and a deadline isn’t realistic, tell me as soon as you see that.
> * If you’re not sure a deadline is firm, ask me so we can line it up with the client.
>
> How does that sound? What would make that workable for you?”

Now you’re negotiating specifics instead of just trading blame.

## Quick Recap to Memorize

Write this somewhere until it’s in your bones:

> **C.A.L.M.S. difficult conversations:**
> **C**enter yourself → **A**im the conversation → **L**isten first
> → **M**irror & validate → **S**ay what you need + next step
