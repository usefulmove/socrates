#+title: Introduction To Doom Emacs

Doom is a configuration of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Emacs][GNU Emacs]] that relies heavily on evil-mode (Vim emulation) consistently throughout the interface. As a result, it operates as a hybrid of Vim and Emacs. In general, Emacs is unbelievably customizable and easy to tailor to your needs.


* Basic Keybindings and Navigation
- efficient keyboard-based text editing
- modal editor (normal mode, insert mode, visual mode)
- cursor (point) movement with j, k, h, l
- jump between words and sentences
- search within files
- bulk search and replace
- jump between open documents (buffers)


* Integrated Environment
- edit multiple documents in a single session
- terminal (term)
- directory navigation (dired)
- scratch pad
- git integration (magit)


* Org Mode
- document editing and organization (similar to an interactive Markdown)
- interactive tables
- links between [[~/repos/enc/src/enc.el][documents]] and out to online [[https://chat.openai.com/?model=gpt-4][sites]]
- export org documents to various formats including HTML, PDF, and more.
- embed code blocks with support for multiple programming languages
