**Interiority** is the experience of a person’s inner world—the thoughts, emotions, reflections, desires, doubts, fears, and spiritual or moral struggles that shape their perspective and choices. It's what’s going on *inside* someone, often hidden from the external world.

In storytelling or psychology, interiority refers to a character’s inner life being made visible—through narration, journal entries, body language, or the unspoken meanings behind their actions. It's the layer that makes someone feel *real*, complex, and human.

Think of it as the difference between **what happens** and **what it *feels like* to go through it**.
