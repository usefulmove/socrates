# Death by Meeting
Patrick Lencioni


## Conflict Mining (Psychology)
- Pay careful attention looking for signs of unspoken conflict and attempt to coax it out into productive discussion. The goal is to have a healthy debate about the tradeoffs of any decision prior to reaching consensus (unlikely, esp. for an intelligent group trying to resolve complex problems) or the leader making a decision once the debate has ended
- Once a decision has been made, everyone on the team is expected to support the decision until and unless additional information warrants reopening the discussion
