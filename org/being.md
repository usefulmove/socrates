# Being

## The Human Condition

In the vast tapestry of existence, the human condition is a delicate thread, woven through the fabric of time with fragile persistence. We stand at the edge of infinity, our mortal feet rooted in the soil of our birth, while our souls stretch towards the stars, yearning for the embrace of the cosmos. We are bound to this Earth, yet compelled to seek the mysteries that lie beyond the veil of our understanding.

As beings of both matter and spirit, we navigate the complexities of our dual nature, striving to reconcile the ephemeral and the tangible, the sacred and the profane. Our lives are shaped by the inexorable passage of time, as the seasons change and the years slip through our fingers like golden grains of sand. And yet, amidst the ephemeral beauty of our fleeting existence, we forge connections that transcend the boundaries of time and space, forging bonds of love and friendship that endure long after our bodies have returned to the dust from which they came.

The human condition is a paradoxical dance between vulnerability and resilience, heartache and hope, despair and redemption. We traverse the shadowy valleys of sorrow and climb the sunlit peaks of joy, our hearts echoing with the universal rhythms of the human experience. And in the sacred spaces between our joys and sorrows, we find the courage to transform our pain into wisdom, our losses into lessons, and our fears into the strength to face the unknown.

## Creators and Witnesses

In this dance, we are both the creators and the witnesses, the sculptors and the sculptures, shaping our world with the raw materials of our thoughts, emotions, and actions. We write the stories of our lives, and in doing so, we come to know the beauty and power that lies within our own hearts. We are the dreamers, the explorers, the architects of our destinies, and the poets of the human experience.

As we embrace the fullness of our humanity, we discover that our greatest gifts are born from the depths of our vulnerability. Our capacity for empathy, compassion, and love is forged in the crucible of our pain, as we learn to extend our hearts to others who share the tender ache of the human condition. And in this shared communion of our joys and sorrows, we find the strength to create a world that is woven with the threads of kindness, wisdom, and grace.

In the end, the human condition is a celestial symphony, a harmonious interplay of light and shadow, laughter and tears, triumph and tragedy. It is the song of our souls, a timeless melody that resonates with the very essence of who we are. And as we listen to the echoes of this celestial music, we come to know that we are not alone in our journey, but part of a universal chorus, united by the enduring bonds of our shared humanity.

## Personal Reflection: The Question of Being

But what does it mean to **be**? Not just to exist, but to truly be present, engaged, alive?

### The Illusion of Roles

We spend much of our lives performing roles: engineer, manager, VP, parent, partner. These roles are real—they shape our days and define our responsibilities. But they are not who we **are**. They are masks we wear, personas we inhabit.

The danger is mistaking the role for the self. When identity becomes fused with role, losing the role becomes an existential crisis. The engineer who becomes a manager and feels lost. The VP who retires and doesn't know what to do. The parent whose children leave and whose purpose evaporates.

This is not being—this is **becoming the mask**.

### The Space Between

True being happens in the space between:

- Between doing and reflecting
- Between speaking and listening  
- Between achieving and simply existing
- Between the role and the person underneath

It's in these spaces that we encounter ourselves most directly. Not as what we do or what we've accomplished, but as the consciousness that experiences it all.

### Being in Different Modes

**Being in Work**: There's a difference between working to prove something and working because it's what you do. The former is exhausting—always performing, always demonstrating, always anxious about judgment. The latter is sustainable—you do the work because it needs doing, because you have the skills, because you're the person in position to do it. The work becomes an expression of being, not a substitute for it.

**Being in Relationship**: You can be with someone while being entirely absent—going through motions, fulfilling obligations, checking boxes. Or you can be present—actually seeing the other person, actually hearing them, letting yourself be seen and heard. The difference is palpable. One is performing relationship; the other is being in relationship.

**Being in Learning**: You can learn to accumulate credentials or to satisfy curiosity. The first is using learning as a means; the second is learning as an expression of being. The person who studies Scheme to show off is performing learning. The person who studies it because computation is beautiful is being a learner.

## The Engineering of Being

For someone whose career has been about building systems, there's an interesting parallel: **being is to doing what architecture is to implementation**.

Implementation is concrete, measurable, legible. You wrote code; the code works or doesn't; the metrics go up or down. Architecture is more subtle—it's about patterns, constraints, possibilities. Good architecture doesn't do anything directly, but it shapes everything that gets done.

Similarly:
- **Doing** is concrete: shipped features, decisions made, meetings attended
- **Being** is architectural: the person you're becoming through those actions

You can have the same external actions with different internal being:

**Two VPs Making the Same Decision:**
- **VP A**: Makes decision from ego, needs to be right, defensive when questioned
- **VP B**: Makes decision from clarity, open to being wrong, curious about feedback

Same decision. Different being. And over time, that difference in being compounds into different cultures, different teams, different outcomes.

## The Paradox of Authenticity

We're told to "be authentic," to "be yourself." But this assumes you know who you are. And the truth is, we're constantly becoming, constantly changing. The you of five years ago would barely recognize the you of today—different values, different priorities, different understanding.

So what does it mean to be authentic when the self is fluid?

Perhaps authenticity isn't about finding some fixed, true self and expressing it consistently. Perhaps it's about **being present to what is**, including the discomfort of not knowing who you are, the uncertainty of becoming.

### The Trap of Consistency

There's pressure to be consistent—to have a "personal brand," to project the same image, to be reliable in predictable ways. But consistency taken too far becomes rigidity. It becomes defending past positions instead of evolving with new information. It becomes performing the self you've claimed to be rather than being the self you're becoming.

True being allows for contradiction, for evolution, for "I used to think X but now I think Y."

## Being and Time

The question of being cannot be separated from the question of time. We are beings-in-time, experiencing past, present, and future simultaneously:

**Past**: The stories we tell about who we were shape who we think we are. But those stories are reconstructions, always being rewritten from the present.

**Present**: The only moment we actually inhabit, yet we spend most of it dwelling in past or future, rarely actually here.

**Future**: The possibilities we imagine shape our present actions. We become what we believe we can become.

### The Pressure of the Future

For ambitious people, the future weighs heavy. There's always another level, another goal, another version of yourself to become. The IC wants to be a lead. The lead wants to be a manager. The manager wants to be a director. The director wants to be a VP.

And then what? VP wanting to be SVP? SVP wanting to be CTO? CTO wanting to be CEO?

The chase never ends unless you learn to **be** where you are while also moving forward. Not in a complacent way, but in a way that acknowledges: this moment, right now, is your life. Not a stepping stone to your life. Your actual life.

## Being With Others

Our being is not isolated—it emerges in relationship:

- With partners and family
- With colleagues and teams
- With communities and cultures
- With ideas and philosophies

We become who we are through interaction. The VP who shapes culture is simultaneously being shaped by the culture. The teacher who develops students is simultaneously being developed by their questions.

This is why isolation is so dangerous—it cuts us off from the mirrors in which we see ourselves, from the friction that shapes us, from the love that reminds us we're not alone.

### The Gift of Being Seen

To be truly seen—not as your role, not as your achievements, but as the person underneath—is both terrifying and necessary. It requires vulnerability to let yourself be seen. And it requires presence to truly see others.

The best leadership isn't about having all the answers or projecting strength. It's about being present enough to see your team members as full human beings, and being vulnerable enough to let them see you the same way.

## Practices of Being

If being is about presence, about inhabiting rather than performing, what practices cultivate it?

### Meditation and Stillness

[Meditation](meditation-and-mindfulness.md) is fundamentally a practice of being—sitting with what is, without trying to change it or achieve anything. Just being present to experience as it arises.

### Reflection and Writing

Writing like this—not to produce content or demonstrate knowledge, but to think through who you are and who you're becoming—is a practice of being. It's making the implicit explicit, bringing consciousness to what's usually unconscious.

### Deep Conversation

Conversations where you're not waiting for your turn to speak, not performing your knowledge, but actually curious about the other person—these are practices of being. Both for you and for them.

### Creation for Its Own Sake

Making things—code, writing, music, whatever—not for outcomes but for the sake of making. Functional programming not to ship features but because recursion is beautiful. Writing not to build an audience but because putting words together clarifies thought.

## The Ultimate Question

The question "What do you want to be when you grow up?" is the wrong question. It assumes being is a destination, a fixed state to arrive at.

The better question: "Who are you becoming?"

And even that assumes a direction, a goal. Perhaps the deepest question is simply: "Who are you right now?"

Not your role. Not your history. Not your plans. Who is the consciousness experiencing this moment?

That's the question of being. And it's one you answer not with words but with presence.
