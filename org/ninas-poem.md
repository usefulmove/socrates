`lovejones` `poem`

"It is the color of light,

 The shape of sound, high in the evergreens.

 It lies suspended in hills,

 a blue line in a red sky

 I am looking at sound.

 I am hearing the brightness of high bluffs and almond trees.

 I am tasting the wilderness of lakes, rivers, and streams

 Caught in an angle of song.

 I am remembering water that glows in the dawn,

 the motion tumbled in earth, life hidden in mounds.

 I am dancing on a bright beam of light...

 I am remembering love."
