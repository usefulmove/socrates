# Were I Pygmalion or God by Walter Benton

Were I Pygmalion or God 
I would make you exactly as you are ... in all dimensions. 
From your warm hair to your intimate toes would you be 

 wholly in your own image. I would change nothing, add or take away. 
The same full red flower would model for your mouth — 
and from the same seashore 
would I bring the small translucent earshapes of your ears.

 O the lovely throat that I could duplicate! 
The tender arms! 
I would shape your breasts the shape of the hungry little faces 
they are now ... and tip them with the same quick mouths.

 I could not make your eyes deeper than they are — 
nor softer to look into ... nor could I turn your hips, your thighs, 
your belly in a sweeter curve: nor indent the hollows 
of your loins more tenderly — or store more honey there or fire.

 How would I name you ... need you ask? You know. By the scarlet 
and the blue you wear when love is upon you, by the yellow 
tongues — by the warm white fragrance ... by the slender leaves.
