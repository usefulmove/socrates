# CO-STAR LLM Prompting Principles

A structured framework for designing effective, clear, and purposeful prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Principles

- **C – Context**  
  Provide background or situational information so the LLM understands the scenario or domain.  
  _Example:_ “Summarize this scientific abstract for a high-school audience.”

- **O – Objective**  
  Clearly state the goal or task the model should accomplish.  
  _Example:_ “Generate three creative marketing taglines for a new eco-friendly water bottle.”

- **S – Style**  
  Specify the desired writing format, voice, or stylistic approach.  
  _Example:_ “Write in a formal, academic tone.”

- **T – Tone**  
  Define the emotional or attitudinal quality of the response.  
  _Example:_ “Respond with an empathetic tone to a customer complaint.”

- **A – Audience**  
  Identify the intended reader to tailor complexity and relevance.  
  _Example:_ “Explain quantum computing to 10-year-olds.”

- **R – Response**  
  Indicate the expected output format, structure, or constraints.  
  _Example:_ “List the top 5 causes in bullet points, each ≤15 words.”

## Purpose
Improves relevance, accuracy, and usability of LLM outputs by reducing ambiguity and encouraging intentional prompt design.

## Use Cases
- Prompt engineering  
- AI-assisted content creation  
- Educational applications  
- LLM-powered application development
