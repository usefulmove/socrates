Telling a great story comes down to a handful of powerful clues—signposts that guide both the teller and the listener:

1. **Emotional truth** – The heart of a great story is a truth that resonates emotionally. It's not about what happened; it’s about what it *meant*.

2. **A clear desire or goal** – The protagonist must *want* something. That desire drives the story forward.

3. **Conflict and stakes** – Obstacles make us care. What might be lost? What’s at risk? This tension keeps people listening.

4. **Transformation** – By the end, someone or something must have changed. A great story traces that arc.

5. **Sensory details** – The *smell* of rain, the *sound* of footsteps, the *look* in someone’s eyes—these ground the story in the body and make it vivid.

6. **Economy and rhythm** – Every word should serve the story. Cut the fat. Let your voice breathe where it needs to.

7. **A satisfying ending** – This doesn’t mean happy. It means *earned*. The end should feel like it couldn't have gone any other way.
