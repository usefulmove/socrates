On Consensus

* The Risks of High Cohesion Without Adequate Decision-Making Procedures

** Why Cohesive Groups Without Structure Fail

Highly cohesive teams often prioritize harmony over critical evaluation. Without structured decision-making procedures, they tend to:

*** Suppress Dissent:** Members may self-censor to maintain group unity.
*** Avoid Conflict:** A desire for consensus discourages questioning or alternative ideas.
*** Rush to Agreement:** Without thorough debate, poor decisions emerge due to insufficient scrutiny.
*** Overestimate Their Accuracy:** Confidence in the group’s ability can lead to overlooking risks.

** Ensuring Adequate Decision-Making Procedures
To counteract these risks, teams should implement:

*** Encouraging Dissent and Debate** – Foster an environment where alternative viewpoints are actively solicited and valued.
*** Structured Decision Methods** – Use frameworks like the *Delphi Method*, *Devil’s Advocacy*, or *Dialectical Inquiry* to ensure thorough evaluation.
*** External Consultation** – Seek input from outside experts to broaden perspectives.
*** Multiple Alternatives** – Consider multiple options before finalizing a decision.
*** Systematic Risk Assessment** – Explicitly identify potential downsides of each decision.
*** Individual Accountability** – Assign responsibility to team members to reduce conformity pressure.
*** Adequate Time for Discussion** – Avoid rushed decisions by allowing sufficient deliberation.
*** Encouraging Minority Opinions** – Protect and encourage dissenting voices to challenge assumptions.

By integrating these practices, teams can leverage their cohesion for better collaboration while mitigating the dangers of groupthink.
