_____________________

waffle recipes are from "joy of cooking" with a small modification - the addition of vanilla in the first recipe. here are the two i used to make at work. you and bobby have fun with these!

Basic Waffles - you have three choices to prepare this recipe: use 4 tablespoons butter for a reduced-fat waffle; 8 tablespoons for a classic light and fluffy waffle; or 16 tablespoons for the crunchiest most delicious waffle imaginable.

preheat your waffle iron. whisk together in a large bowl (dry ingredients):

1-3/4 cups all purpose flour

2 tablespoon baking powder

1 tablespoon sugar

1/2 teaspoon salt

whisk together in another bowl (wet ingredients):

3 large eggs, well beaten

1-1/2 cups milk

4 to 15 tablespoons (1/2 to 2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted

1-2 teaspoons of vanilla (to taste)

[beat the eggs and milk first, whisk while slowly adding the melted butter or you will cook your eggs]

make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the wet ingredients. gently whisk them together with a few swift strokes. the batter should have a pebbled look, similar to a muffin batter.

Belgian Waffles - this one is really good, too

whisk together:

1 envelope (2-1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast

1/4 cup warm milk (105 to 115 degrees F)

let stand until yeast is dissolved, about 5 minutes.

whisk together in a large bowl:

3 large egg yolks

1/4 cup lukewarm milk

12 tablespoons (1-1/2 sticks) unsalted butter melted and cooled to lukewarm

whisk in the yeast mixture along with:

1/2 cup sugar

1-1/2 teaspoons salt

2 teaspoons vanilla

Add in three parts:

4 cups all purpose flour

alternating in two parts with:

2-1/2 cups warm milk (105 to 115 degrees F)

Beat until soft peaks form then fold into the batter:

3 large egg whites

cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour, then stir to deflate the batter.
