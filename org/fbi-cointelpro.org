* Primary Documents
Here are *primary documents* (with tiny quotes) showing COINTELPRO in the FBI’s own words:

** Aug. 25, 1967 directive (launching the “Black Nationalist–Hate Groups” COINTELPRO).
Purpose: “*to expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize*” targeted groups and their supporters. Lists initial targets and tactics.  
[[church1][Church Committee Archive]]

** Stated goals: stop a unifying Black leader.
FBI memo summarized by the Senate says: “*Prevent the rise of a messiah who could unify and electrify the militant nationalist movement*,” naming King, Carmichael, and Elijah Muhammad.

** Orders to stoke conflicts against the Panthers.
Hoover told field offices to submit “*imaginative and hard-hitting counterintelligence measures*” to exploit a “gang warfare” climate between the Black Panther Party and US Organization.

** Fred Hampton raid—FBI informant intel handed to police.
Chicago FBI memo notes *a detailed floor plan and weapons inventory* for Hampton’s apartment were *furnished to local authorities* and “*proved to be of tremendous value*” for the 12/4/69 raid.

** The anonymous “suicide letter” to Dr. King (1964).
The typed letter (scan available) tells King “*You are done*,” implying he should end his life; it accompanied surveillance tapes. (FOIA vault + scan.)

** Congress’s judgment on COINTELPRO.
The Church Committee concluded the FBI used “*unsavory and vicious tactics*” (including anonymous attempts to break up marriages) and engaged in *lawless* methods against political activists.

* Notes
If you want, I can pull the *exact pages* from those PDFs into a quick packet, or dig up more (e.g., Klan and New Left COINTELPRO files, MLK wiretap authorizations).
