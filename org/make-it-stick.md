# *Make It Stick*

The book's most crucial insight is that effective learning is **effortful** and often feels counter-intuitive.

## The Core Principle: Active Retrieval

The single most important practice is **retrieval**: actively pulling information *out* of your memory. This is far more effective than passively putting information *in* (like rereading or highlighting). If you remember only one thing, it's this: **stop rereading, start quizzing**.

## The Three Most Important Techniques

These three strategies form the practical core of effective learning.

1.  **Test Yourself, Constantly (Retrieval Practice)**
    * **What it is:** The act of self-testing. Use flashcards, answer end-of-chapter questions (without peeking), or simply close the book and summarize the main points aloud or on paper.
    * **Why it works:** Actively recalling information strengthens neural pathways, making memories more durable and flexible. It also reveals what you don't actually know (calibration), which is a blind spot for passive review.

2.  **Space It Out (Spaced Repetition)**
    * **What it is:** Study and practice retrieval over time, rather than cramming it all into one session. Allow some time to pass so you begin to forget.
    * **Why it works:** Forcing your brain to reconstruct a memory after a delay requires more effort and strengthens long-term retention. **Cramming creates the illusion of mastery** but leads to rapid forgetting.

3.  **Mix It Up (Interleaving)**
    * **What it is:** Varying the subjects or skills you study in a single session. Instead of studying topic AAAA, then BBBB, then CCCC, study ABCABCABC. For example, in math, work on a problem set that mixes different types of problems instead of doing all of one type at once.
    * **Why it works:** While it feels harder and slower, interleaving teaches your brain to differentiate between concepts and select the correct strategy for a given problem, leading to deeper and more flexible knowledge.

## The Golden Rule

**Embrace desirable difficulty.** If your study session feels easy and fluent, you're probably not learning efficiently. The struggle to recall, the initial confusion between mixed topics, and the effort to put concepts into your own words are the very processes that build lasting knowledge.
