# the matching principle
Successful communication requires identifying what kind of conversation is happening and matching it (either by matching the other person or by inviting them to match you).

- teacher construct:
  - "Do you want to be *helped* (practical), do you want to be *hugged* (emotional), or do you want to be *heard* (social)?"

- another approach (better for adults):
  - ask deep questions
    - invite them to share their *values*, *beliefs*, or *experiences*
  - example:
    - instead of: "Where do you work?"
    - ask: "What to you love about your job?"
  - example:
    - instead of: "Where did you go to high school?"
    - ask: "What was high school like? ... How did it change you?"
