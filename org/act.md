# Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a form of psychotherapy focused on psychological flexibility—the ability to be present, accept what's out of your control, and take action toward what matters.

## Core Principles
| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| Acceptance | Allow difficult thoughts/feelings to exist rather than fighting them |
| Defusion | See thoughts as just thoughts, not absolute truth |
| Present Moment | Stay focused on here and now |
| Self as Context | View yourself as the observer of experiences |
| Values | Clarify what truly matters to you |
| Committed Action | Take steps aligned with your values, even when uncomfortable |


## The Goal
Instead of eliminating negative thoughts/feelings, ACT teaches you to carry them with you while living a meaningful life aligned with your values.
